If you're interested in using Rich Presence, please read our [SDK Starter Guide](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/) and check out the relevant functions in the [Activity Manager](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/).\n\n## New Invite Object Fields\n\n#### April 18, 2019\n\nThe [Invite Object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_INVITE/invite-object) now includes two additional fields, `target_user` and `target_user_type`.\n\n## Ask to Join & Rich Presence SDK\n\n#### January 14, 2019\n\nAsk to Join no longer requires approval or whitelisting to use. You are welcome to create in-game UI, but all Ask to Join requests are also now handled by the Discord overlay.\n\nThere have also been some small additions to the Rich Presence SDK. The previously undocumented `UpdateHandlers()` function is now documented.\n\n## Documentation: Dispatch Store Listings\n\n#### December 11, 2018\n\nDispatch documentation around store listings has been removed. Store pages for the Discord Store are now managed entirely within the [Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers).\n\n## Enhancement: User Object\n\n#### November 30, 2018\n\nThe [User object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) now includes two new additional fields, `premium_type` and `flags`. These can be used to know the Nitro status of a user, or determine which HypeSquad house a user is in.\n\n## Documentation Fix: List of Open DMS in Certain Payloads\n\n#### June 19, 2018\n\nThe documentation has been updated to correctly note that the `private_channels` field in the [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) should be an empty array, as well as the response from `/users/@me/channels` for a bot user. This change has been in effect for a long time, but the documentation was not updated.\n\n## Deprecation: RPC online member count and members list\n\n#### June 11, 2018\n\nWe released server changes that allow guilds to represent an incomplete state of the member list in our clients, which results in inaccurate member lists and online counts over RPC. These fields are now deprecated and will now return an empty members array and an online count of 0 moving forward.\n\n## Enhancement: New Message Properties\n\n#### February 5, 2018\n\nAdditional `activity` and `application` fields—as well as corresponding object documentation—have been added to the [Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object in support of our newly-released [Spotify integration](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000167212-Discord-Spotify-Connection) and previous Rich Presence enhancements.\n\n## Enhancement: Get Guild Emoji Endpoint\n\n#### January 30, 2018\n\nThe [Get Guild Emoji](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/get-guild-emoji) response now also includes a user object if the emoji was added by a user.\n\n## Deprecation: Accept Invite Endpoint\n\n#### January 23, 2018\n\nThe [Accept Invite](#DOCS_RESOURCES_INVITE/accept-invite) endpoint is deprecated starting today, and will be discontinued on March 23, 2018. The [Add Guild Member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/add-guild-member) endpoint should be used in its place.\n\n## Semi-Breaking Change: Very Large Bot Sharding\n\n#### January 3, 2018\n\nAdditional sharding requirements and information for bots in over 100,000 guilds has been added. This requires a small change in numbers of shards for affected bots. See the [documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sharding-for-very-large-bots) for more information.\n\n## New Feature: Rich Presence\n\n#### November 9, 2017\n\nRich Presence is now live and available for all developers! Rich Presence allows developers to closely integrate with Discord in a number of new, cool ways like:\n\n- Showing more information about a user's current game in their profile\n- Allowing users to post invitations to join their party or spectate their game in chat\n- Displaying \"Spectate\" and \"Ask to Join\" buttons on users' profiles\n\nFor more information, check out our [Rich Presence site](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence). To get started on development, [read the docs](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_HOW_TO/)!\n\n## Breaking Change: API & Gateway Below v6 Discontinued\n\n#### October 16, 2017\n\n[API](#DOCS_REFERENCE/api-versioning) and [Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-protocol-versions) versions below v6 are now discontinued after being previously deprecated. Version 6 is now the default API and Gateway version. Attempting to use a version below 6 will result in an error.\n\n## New Feature: Channel Categories\n\n#### September 20, 2017\n\nChanges have been made throughout the documentation to reflect the addition of channel categories to Discord. These includes an additional field—`parent_id`—to the base [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-obect) object and a new [channel category example](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-example-channel-category).\n\n## New Feature: Emoji Endpoints\n\n#### September 10, 2017\n\n[Emoji endpoints](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-resource) have been added to the API. Bots can now manage guild emojis to their robo-hearts' content!\n\n## Breaking Change: Presence Activity Objects\n\n#### August 16, 2017\n\nThe `type` field in the [activity object](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/activity-object) for [Gateway Status Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-status) and [Presence Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update) payloads is no longer optional when the activity object is not null.\n\n## Breaking Change: Default Channels\n\n#### August 3, 2017\n\nAfter today, we are changing how default channels function. The \"default\" channel for a given user is now the channel with the highest position that their permissions allow them to see. New guilds will no longer have a default channel with the same id as the guild. Existing guilds will not have their #general channel id changed. It is possible, if permissions are set in such a way, that a user will not have a default channel in a guild.\n\nWe saw a use case in many servers where the previously-default #general channel was being repurposed as an announcement-only, non-writable channel for new members by using bots to clear the entire message history. Now, that channel can simply be deleted and re-created with the desired permissions. This change also allows dynamic default channels for users based on permissions.\n\nWe are also rolling out a change in conjunction that will allow Discord to remember your last-visited channel in a guild across sessions. Newly-joined users will be directed to the guild's default channel on first join; existing members will return to whichever channel they last visited.\n\n## New Feature: Audit Logs\n\n#### July 24, 2017\n\nAudit logs are here! Well, they've been here all along, but now we've got [documentation](#DOCS_AUDIT_LOG/audit-logs) about them. Check it out, but remember: with great power comes great responsibility.\n\n## Breaking Change: Version 6\n\n#### July 19, 2017\n\n- [Channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) Object\n  - `is_private` removed\n  - [`type`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-channel-types) is now an integer\n  - `recipient` is now `recipients`, an array of [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) objects\n- [Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) Object\n  - [`type`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object-message-types) added to support system messages\n- [Status Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-status-gateway-status-update-structure) Object\n  - `idle_since` renamed to `since`\n"},1963:function(e,n){e.exports="# Introduction\n\nYou’ve found the Discord Developer Documentation!

THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS\nAGREEMENT DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER RIGHTS THAT\nCANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. Some jurisdictions do not allow the\nexclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,\nwhich means that some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you. IN\nTHESE JURISDICTIONS, DISCORD’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE\nGREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\nIT IS EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT IN THE EVENT ANY REMEDY\nHEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, ALL\nLIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH HEREIN\nSHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT.\n\n### 9\\. INDEMNIFICATION\n\nLicensee, at its own expense, shall defend, indemnify and hold\nharmless Discord and its affiliates, and its and their employees, contractors, agents, directors and\ncustomers from and against any and all claims, actions, demands, liabilities, losses, damages,\njudgments, settlements, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (any or all of\nthe foregoing hereinafter referred to as “Losses”), insofar as such Losses (or third party actions\nin respect thereof) are based on, arise out of, or are related to (i) a breach by Licensee of any\nrepresentation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it hereunder or (ii) the use, operation,\npromotion, distribution or license of the Applications by Licensee or its employees, contractors\nor agents.\n\n### 10\\.

The most common use case of the Discord API will be providing a service, or access to a platform through the [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) API.\n\n###### Base URL\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api\n```\n\n## API Versioning\n\n>danger\n>Some API and Gateway versions are now non-functioning, and are labeled as discontinued in the table below for posterity. Trying to use these versions will fail and return 400 Bad Request.\n\nDiscord exposes different versions of our API. You can specify version by including it in the request path like `https://discordapp.com/api/v{version_number}`. Omitting the version number from the route will route requests to the current default version (marked below accordingly). You can find the change log for the newest API version [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/change-log).\n\n###### API Versions\n\n| Version | Status | Default |\n| ------- | ------ | ------- |\n| 6 | Available | ✓ |\n| 5 | Discontinued | |\n| 4 | Discontinued | |\n| 3 | Discontinued | | |\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthenticating with the Discord API can be done in one of two ways:\n\n1. Using a bot token gained by [registering a bot](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/registering-applications), for more information on bots see [bots vs user accounts](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/bot-vs-user-accounts).\n2. Using an OAuth2 bearer token gained through the [OAuth2 API](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/oauth2).\n\nFor all authentication types, authentication is performed with the `Authorization` HTTP header in the format `Authorization: TOKEN_TYPE TOKEN`.\n\n###### Example Bot Token Authorization Header\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bot MTk4NjIyNDgzNDcxOTI1MjQ4.Cl2FMQ.ZnCjm1XVW7vRze4b7Cq4se7kKWs\n```\n\n###### Example Bearer Token Authorization Header\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer CZhtkLDpNYXgPH9Ml6shqh2OwykChw\n```\n\n## Encryption\n\nAll HTTP-layer services and protocols (e.g. http, websocket) within the Discord API use TLS 1.2.\n\n## Snowflakes\n\nDiscord utilizes Twitter's [snowflake](https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/tree/snowflake-2010) format for uniquely identifiable descriptors (IDs). These IDs are guaranteed to be unique across all of Discord, except in some unique scenarios in which child objects share their parent's ID. Because Snowflake IDs are up to 64 bits in size (e.g. a uint64), they are always returned as strings in the HTTP API to prevent integer overflows in some languages. See [Gateway ETF/JSON](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/etf-json) for more information regarding Gateway encoding.\n\n###### Snowflake ID Broken Down in Binary\n\n```\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 11111 11111 111111111111\n64                                         22    17    12          0\n```\n\n###### Snowflake ID Format Structure (Left to Right)\n\n| Field | Bits | Number of bits | Description | Retrieval |\n|-------|------|----------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Timestamp | 63 to 22 | 42 bits | Milliseconds since Discord Epoch, the first second of 2015 or 1420070400000. | ``(snowflake >> 22) + 1420070400000`` |\n| Internal worker ID | 21 to 17 | 5 bits | | ``(snowflake & 0x3E0000) >> 17`` |\n| Internal process ID | 16 to 12 | 5 bits | | ``(snowflake & 0x1F000) >> 12`` |\n| Increment | 11 to 0 | 12 bits | For every ID that is generated on that process, this number is incremented | ``snowflake & 0xFFF`` |\n\n### Convert Snowflake to DateTime\n\n![snowflake-composition](snowflake.png)\n\n### Snowflake IDs in Pagination\n\nWe typically use snowflake IDs in many of our API routes for pagination. The standardized pagination paradigm we utilize is one in which you can specify IDs `before` and `after` in combination with `limit` to retrieve a desired page of results. You will want to refer to the specific endpoint documentation for details.\n\nIt is useful to note that snowflake IDs are just numbers with a timestamp, so when dealing with pagination where you want results from the beginning of time (in Discord Epoch, but `0` works here too) or before/after a specific time you can generate a snowflake ID for that time.\n\n###### Generating a snowflake ID from a Timestamp Example\n\n```\ntimestamp_ms - DISCORD_EPOCH << 22\n```\n\n## Nullable and Optional Resource Fields\n\nResource fields that may contain a `null` value have types that are prefixed with a question mark.\nResource fields that are optional have names that are suffixed with a question mark.\n\n###### Example Nullable and Optional Fields\n\n| Field | Type |\n| ----- | ---- |\n| optional_field? | string |\n| nullable_field | ?string |\n| optional_and_nullable_field? | ?string |\n\n## Consistency\n\nDiscord operates at a scale where true consistency is impossible. Because of this, lots of operations in our API and in-between our services are [eventually consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency). Due to this, client actions can never be serialized and may be executed in _any_ order (if executed at all). Along with these constraints, events in Discord may:\n\n- Never be sent to a client\n- Be sent _exactly_ one time to the client\n- Be sent up to N times per client\n\nClients should operate on events and results from the API in as much of a idempotent behavior as possible.\n\n## HTTP API\n\n### User Agent\n\nClients using the HTTP API must provide a valid [User Agent](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.43) which specifies information about the client library and version in the following format:\n\n###### User Agent Example\n\n```\nUser-Agent: DiscordBot ($url, $versionNumber)\n```\n\nClients may append more information and metadata to the _end_ of this string as they wish.\n\n### Rate Limiting\n\nThe HTTP API implements a process for limiting and preventing excessive requests in accordance with [RFC 6585](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4). API users that regularly hit and ignore rate limits will have their API keys revoked, and be blocked from the platform. For more information on rate limiting of requests, please see the [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits) section.\n\n## Gateway (WebSocket) API\n\nDiscord's Gateway API is used for maintaining persistent, stateful websocket connections between your client and our servers. These connections are used for sending and receiving real-time events your client can use to track and update local state. The Gateway API uses secure websocket connections as specified in [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455). For information on opening Gateway connections, please see the [Gateway API](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways) section.\n\n>warn\n>A bot must connect to and identify with a gateway at least once before it can use the [Create Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/create-message) endpoint.\n>If your only requirement is to send messages to a channel, consider using a [Webhook](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK) instead.\n\n## Message Formatting\n\nDiscord utilizes a subset of markdown for rendering message content on its clients, while also adding some custom functionality to enable things like mentioning users and channels. This functionality uses the following formats:\n\n###### Formats\n\n| Type | Structure | Example |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| User | <@USER_ID> | <@80351110224678912> |\n| User (Nickname) | <@!USER_ID> | <@!80351110224678912> |\n| Channel | <#CHANNEL_ID> | <#103735883630395392> |\n| Role | <@&ROLE_ID> | <@&165511591545143296> |\n| Custom Emoji | <:NAME:ID> | <:mmLol:216154654256398347> |\n| Custom Emoji (Animated) | <a:NAME:ID> | <a:b1nzy:392938283556143104> |\n\nUsing the markdown for either users, roles, or channels will mention the target(s) accordingly.\n\n## Image Formatting\n\n###### Image Base Url\n\n```\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/\n```\n\nDiscord uses ids and hashes to render images in the client. These hashes can be retrieved through various API requests, like [Get User](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-user). Below are the formats, size limitations, and CDN endpoints for images in Discord. The returned format can be changed by changing the [extension name](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting-image-formats) at the end of the URL. The returned size can be changed by appending a querystring of `?size=desired_size` to the URL. Image size can be any power of two between 16 and 2048.\n\n###### Image Formats\n\n| Name | Extension |\n|-------|------------|\n| JPEG | .jpg, .jpeg |\n| PNG | .png |\n| WebP | .webp |\n| GIF | .gif |\n\n###### CDN Endpoints\n\n| Type | Path | Supports |\n| ---- | --- | -------- |\n| Custom Emoji | emojis/[emoji_id](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object).png | PNG, GIF |\n| Guild Icon | icons/[guild_id](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object)/[guild_icon](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object).png | PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF |\n| Guild Splash | splashes/[guild_id](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object)/[guild_splash](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object).png | PNG, JPEG, WebP |\n| Guild Banner | banners/[guild_id](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object)/[guild_banner](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object).png | PNG, JPEG, WebP |\n| Default User Avatar | embed/avatars/[user_discriminator](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object).png * | PNG |\n| User Avatar | avatars/[user_id](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object)/[user_avatar](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object).png \\*\\* | PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF |\n| Application Icon | app-icons/[application_id](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top)/[icon](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/get-current-application-information).png | PNG, JPEG, WebP |\n| Application Asset | app-assets/[application_id](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top)/[asset_id](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/activity-object-activity-assets).png | PNG, JPEG, WebP |\n\n\\* In the case of the Default User Avatar endpoint, the value for `user_discriminator` in the path should be the user's discriminator modulo 5—Test#1337 would be `1337 % 5`, which evaluates to 2.\n\n\\*\\* In the case of endpoints that support GIFs, the hash will begin with `a_` if it is available in GIF format.

The Discord Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into this Agreement.\n\n### 4\\. Marketing and Publicity\n\n4.1 **Marketing.** Discord may, at its own expense and sole discretion, market and promote the Apps via Discord Store and other channels, including but not limited to the Discord and Discord Store web sites and shall include the right to distribute promotional copies of the App(s).\n\n4.2 **Press Releases and Press Accounts.** Discord and Developer may reference in public statements the fact that the Apps are or will be available on Discord Store; however, any press release about the other Party shall be subject to the prior approval of the other Party. Discord may make the Apps available to journalists via press subscription accounts free-of- charge in order to enable such journalists to evaluate and review the Apps.\n\n4.3 **Demo Versions.** If Developer releases a Demo Version outside of the Discord Store that includes a reference regarding the method(s) to purchase the App, Developer shall cooperate with Discord to include a reference to Discord Store in that version.\n\n### 5\\. Support\n\n5.1 **Developer Support to Discord.** Developer shall with respect to each App: (a) correct within a reasonable period of time all material bugs, errors, or defects in the Apps (collectively, “Errors”) of which Discord informs Developer; (b) deliver all App Updates when made available to any other third party; (c) provide such other reasonable additional support as Discord may reasonably request. If, in Discord's sole judgment, an App contains Errors or is otherwise of insufficient quality to meet Discord’s standards, it may suspend the availability of such App in the Discord Store.  In the event Discord has suspended the availability of all Apps under this Agreement, it may terminate this Agreement for convenience. In addition, Developer must implement the Discord Store SDK in a manner that is safe and secure for the Discord Store Account Owner.  Discord may, but shall not be obligated to, correct any security vulnerabilities in Developer’s implementation of the Discord Store SDK and Developer shall provide assistance with such corrections as requested by Discord.  If Discord cannot reasonably correct any such vulnerabilities, or Discord determines that Developer should correct them, Developer shall correct such vulnerabilities.\n\n5.2 **Developer Support to End Users.** Developer will provide support to Discord Store Account Owners who have acquired a copy of the Apps, at the same level that Developer provides customer support for such applications made available directly or via other channels. Such support shall include but not be limited to responding to questions and assisting customers in the diagnosis and correction of issues encountered in using the Apps.\n\n5.3 **Discord End User Support.** Provided that Developer has complied with its support obligations in this Section 5, Discord will provide a reasonable level of support for issues related to Discord Store reported by Discord Store Account Owners.\n\n### 6\\. Revenue, Reporting, and Payments\n\n6.1 **Licensee Fees or Other Fees.** Within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month, Discord will provide to Developer a report of Gross Revenue and Net Revenue for such month (each a “Monthly Report”). Each Monthly Report will contain activity for the current month as well as any Net Revenue adjustments for prior months reported by payment processors in the current month. Unless mutually agreed by Discord and Developer in a separate written agreement executed by both parties, Discord will pay to Developer ninety percent (90%) of the Net Revenue on the Monthly Report (the “License Fees”) within thirty (30) days after the Monthly Report is published, in no event later than sixty (60) days from the end of the of the calendar month covered by the Monthly Report. For completeness' sake, the remaining ten percent (10%) of the Net Revenue retained by Discord shall be payment of the consideration by Developer to Discord for the services and activities performed by Discord under this Agreement. Developer acknowledges and agrees that Discord, in the course of acting as agent or commissionaire of Developer, is hosting the Apps, and is allowing the download of those Apps by Discord Store Account Owners, on behalf of or respectively for the risk and account of Developer. All of the Apps and App-Related Content shall be marketed by Discord, on behalf of Developer, to Discord Store Account Owners at the prices established by Developer. Developer may change the price for any Apps or App-Related Content at any time, at Developer’s discretion, upon notice to Discord. As agent or commissionaire for Developer, Discord shall be solely responsible for the collection of all prices payable by Discord Store Account Owners for Apps acquired by those Discord Store Account Owners.\n\n6.2 **Taxes.** In the event that any remittance made by Discord to Developer is subject to any VAT, the full amount of such VAT shall be solely for the account of Developer, and will not reduce Discord's fee amount to which Discord is entitled on such transaction. To the extent required under applicable law, Discord will deduct the full amount of such VAT from the amount owed to Developer, and will pay the full amount withheld to the competent tax authorities. Discord will use commercially reasonably efforts to obtain, and to furnish to Developer, copies of official tax receipts or similar evidence of payment, confirming payment of such VAT to the competent tax authorities. Developer will indemnify and hold Discord harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authorities for any underpayment of any VAT, and any penalties and/or interest thereon, including, but not limited to, underpayments attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by Developer as to its entitlement to, or any disqualification of Developer for, the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding tax..\n\n6.3 **Minimum Monthly Payment and Negative Amounts.** In the event amounts due to Developer for a given month do not exceed one hundred U.S. dollars ($100), Discord may elect to not remit payment for that month, and may instead accumulate payments due until they exceed one hundred U.S. dollars ($100) as of the end of a future monthly payment cycle. Also, to the extent that the payment calculation in a Monthly Report results in a negative amount, that negative amount will be carried forward and deducted from any future amounts otherwise payable to Developer by Discord under this Agreement.\n\n6.4 **Multi-Platform Apps.** To the extent that Developer has submitted to Discord Store versions of an App for multiple operating systems (for example, a Mac version, and a Windows version) such versions shall be sold together as a single \"hybrid\" App unit on Discord Store. Accordingly, a Mac version of any App, a Windows version of an App, and a Linux version of an App shall not be considered separate sales when calculating the payments due to Developer hereunder.\n\n### 7\\. Term\n\n7.1 **Term.** The term of this Agreement (“Term”) shall begin on the Effective Date and continue until the end of the latest App Term for any App unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n7.2 **App Term.** With respect to each App, the App Term shall commence on the GA Date for such App and continue for one (1) year (the “Initial App Term”); and for any renewal period mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing.\n\n7.3 **Termination for Cause.** Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice at any time if the other party is in breach of this Agreement and has failed to cure that breach within thirty (30) days after written notice of that breach. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party (a) becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (b) files a petition, or has a third party file a petition with respect to it, under any bankruptcy or similar statute; or (c) materially breaches this Agreement and such breach is not capable of cure.\n\n7.4 **Termination for Convenience.** Either party may terminate this Agreement for convenience (with or without cause) by providing the other party with thirty (30) days prior written notice of such termination, provided that during such period the parties have reasonably discussed and agreed on a process for sunsetting the Apps (a “Sunset Process”). In the event that a Sunset Process has not been agreed upon within such 30-day period, or the Sunset Process requires that this Agreement remain fully in force for longer than such 30-day period, this Agreement will not terminate until the completion of the Sunset Process.. In addition, Discord may terminate this Agreement immediately at any time upon written notice to Developer in the event that Discord (a) determines in its discretion that any or all Apps are not suitable for distribution via the Discord Store or (b) ceases to operate the Discord Store or the self-service portion of the Discord Store.\n\n7.5 **Survival.** Sections 2.5, 2.6, 3.1 - 3.7, 5.2 (only with respect to supporting Discord Store Account Owners that have licensed an App prior to termination or expiration), 6 (only with respect to amounts that accrued prior to termination or expiration), 7.5, and 8 - 13, and any then-existing Discord Store Account Owner licenses to Apps, shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n### 8\\. Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n8.1 **Mutual Representations and Warranties.** Each party represents and warrants that (a) this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by such party; (b) it has all necessary power and authority to execute and perform its obligations under this Agreement; and (c) its execution and performance of this Agreement will not violate any applicable law or regulation or violate any rights of, or breach any obligation owed to, a third party.\n\n8.2 **Developer Representations and Warranties.** Developer represents and warrants that (a) it originally created the Apps (which, for purposes of this Section 8.2, include Demo Versions, Localized Versions and App Updates) and the Developer Marks, or otherwise has the rights necessary to grant the licenses and to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement; (b) the Apps will conform to any documentation for the Apps; (c) the Apps and the Developer Marks do not infringe any right of any third party, including but not limited to any intellectual property right or right of publicity or privacy; (d) the Apps do not violate any terms of the Discord Store Subscriber Agreement; (e) it is in compliance with and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and its privacy policy, in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to its use of any end user data supplied by Discord to Developer under this Agreement; (f) it has all necessary rights to any content or information it submits to Discord through the Discord Store partner portal or using any Discord Store-provided partner or publishing tools; and (g) the Apps do not contain any software viruses, trojan horses, or any other harmful or malicious code. Developer further represents and warrants that neither it nor its agents are on any list maintained by the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of persons, entities, or prohibited or restricted jurisdictions (“Restricted List”) and Developer shall promptly notify Discord in writing if it is no longer in compliance with, or is likely to become noncompliant with, the foregoing representation or warranty. In such event, or if Developer or any of its agents are on any OFAC Restricted List, Discord, in addition to any other remedies, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately without providing Developer an opportunity to cure.\n\n8.3 **Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ALL MATERIAL PROVIDED BY SUCH PARTY HEREUNDER IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION.**\n\n### 9\\. Indemnification\n\nDeveloper will indemnify, defend (upon Discord’s written request), and hold harmless Discord and its Affiliates, successors, officers, directors and employees from any loss, liability, expense or damage (including attorneys’ fees) (“Liabilities”) arising out of any third party action, cause of action, claim or demand (each, a “Claim”) alleging a breach by Developer of its representations and warranties under Section 8 of this Agreement. Discord will promptly notify Developer of a Claim, provided that any delay in providing such notice shall relieve Developer of its obligations only to the extent that such delay materially prejudiced Developer. If Discord requests Developer to defend a Claim, Discord shall give Developer sole control of the defense of the Claim, provided that Developer shall not settle or otherwise dispose of any Claim in any manner that imposes fault or other liability on Discord. Discord may, at its own expense, participate in any such defense with its own counsel.\n\n### 10\\. Limitation of Liability\n\nEXCEPT FOR BREACH OF SECTION 12 (CONFIDENTIALITY), IN NO EVENT SHALL DISCORD BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR (B) ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE) THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PROVISION HEREIN, REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY UPON WHICH ANY CLAIM FOR SUCH DAMAGES IS BASED. THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\n### 11\\. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue\n\nThis Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without reference to conflicts of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between the parties that arises in whole or in part from this Agreement or Developer’s use of the Discord Store shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California. Developer hereby consents to, and waives all defenses with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of Santa Clara County, California.\n\n### 12\\. Confidentiality\n\n12.1 \"**Confidential Information**\" means all non-public information that is identified as being confidential or which should reasonably be understood to be confidential, which includes without limitation, information relating to released or unreleased products, marketing or promotion of any product, financial information, business policies or practices, personnel, pricing and sales information, technology, computer programs, unpublished works of original authorship, trade secrets, or information received from third parties that the disclosing party is obligated to treat as confidential. Without limiting the foregoing, the terms of this Agreement and Sales Data shall be Discord’s Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally known or available by publication, commercial use or otherwise through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) is known by the receiving party without restriction at the time of disclosure; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without the use of any Confidential Information received from the disclosing party; or (iv) is lawfully obtained without restriction from a third party that has the right to make such disclosure.\n\n12.2 The receiving party shall use Confidential Information it receives solely in connection with its performance under this Agreement, and shall disclose such Confidential Information only to employees and contractors who have a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement and are bound by written confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those herein. The receiving party shall protect Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure and use with the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event less than reasonable care.\n\n12.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as necessary to comply with any court order or applicable law or regulation, provided that such party to the extent reasonably possible gives prior written notice to the other party of the possibility of such disclosure and to resist or limit disclosure, including without limitation reasonably cooperating with the other party in seeking a protective order or other similar relief.\n\n12.4 After termination of this Agreement or receiving earlier written request from the other party, the receiving party shall promptly return or delete the Confidential Information received from the disclosing party.\n\n### 13\\. General Provisions\n\n13.1 **Independent Contractor.** The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. This Agreement does not create any joint venture, partnership, or other business entity.\n\n13.2 **Notices.** Any notices required by this Agreement must be sent in writing via overnight delivery by a nationally recognized courier service (e.g., FedEx) or first-class mail, signature required and shall be deemed effective upon signature acknowledging receipt by the party receiving notice. All such notices must be addressed to the receiving party at the address stated at the top of this Agreement with attention to the individual executing this Agreement on behalf of such party.\n\n13.3 **Assignment.** Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or its rights hereunder without the other party’s prior written consent, except that such consent shall not be required for (a) a party to transfer this Agreement to an Affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or other corporate combination, or the sale of all or substantially all of such party’s assets, provided that the successor party is not a competitor of the non-transferring party and the transferring party provides prompt notice of such transfer; or (b) Discord to assign, or sublicense some or all of, its rights under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates or to a subcontractor. Such transfer or assignment shall not relieve the transferring or assigning party of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted transfer or assignment by either party in violation of this Section shall be void and of no effect and will constitute a breach by the party attempting such transfer or assignment. This Agreement will be binding upon any permitted successor.\n\n13.4 **Headings.** The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.\n\n13.5 **Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n13.6 **No Waiver.** The failure of a party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, and no waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.\n\n13.7 **Modifications.** This Agreement may not be modified except by a written agreement dated signed on behalf of Discord and Developer by their respective duly authorized representatives.\n\n13.8 **Complete Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous communications and agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Neither party has relied in entering into this Agreement on any statement, inducement or representation that is not set forth in this Agreement. Each party agrees that electronic signatures may be used to authenticate this writing and, if so used, will have the same force and effect as manual signatures.\n"},1967:function(e,n){e.exports='# Branches and Builds\n\n> info\n> Need help with Dispatch? Talk to us at [dis.gd/devsupport](https://dis.gd/devsupport)\n\nIn order for other people to download your game from Discord\'s servers, you need to _upload_ your game to Discord\'s servers. Let\'s learn how to do that!\n\n## Getting Set Up\n\nFirst, get Dispatch for your operating system.\n\n- [Windows 64](https://dl-dispatch.discordapp.net/download/win64)\n- [Windows 32](https://dl-dispatch.discordapp.net/download/win32)\n- [Mac](https://dl-dispatch.discordapp.net/download/macos)\n- [Linux](https://dl-dispatch.discordapp.net/download/linux)\n\nYou\'ll want to be able to use Dispatch across your projects, so let\'s handle that now by adding it to our PATH.\n\n**MacOS/Linux:**\n\nBust out those \\*nix skills.\n\n- Open your choice of terminal\n- Stick dispatch in a folder that will be added to your PATH. If you don\'t have a good spot for this stuff already, you can `mkdir ~/bin/` and call that Dispatch\'s new home (as well as any other executables you might want to access in the future)\n- In that folder, run `chmod u+x dispatch-macos` so that Dispatch can be used as an executable\n  - Feel free to also rename `dispatch-macos` to just `dispatch` if you don\'t feel like typing so much\n- Add that ~/bin directory to your path in a permanent way. I have `export PATH=$PATH:~/bin` at the bottom of my `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bashrc`\n- Restart your terminal\n- `echo $PATH` and make sure you see the directory in the output\n- Run `dispatch --help` to make sure it works\n\nYou\'re good! You can now call the dispatch command from anywhere!\n\n**Windows**\n\nNot as 1337 as some scripting skillz, but the Windows GUI will do just fine\n\n- Stick `dispatch-x64` or `dispatch-x86`, depending on your OS, in a folder that will be added to your PATH\n  - Feel free to rename it to just `dispatch` if you don\'t feel like typing so much\n- Hit that Windows key and start typing "Environment Variables"\n- Select "Edit the system environment variables"\n- Hit the "Environment Variables" button in the bottom right\n- Edit the PATH entry for either the system or the current user, adding dispatch\'s directory\n- Restart your command line\n- Run `dispatch --help` to make sure it works\n\nYou\'re good! You can now call the dispatch command from anywhere!\n\n> info\n> Want some really fancy skills? You can set up autocompletions for dispatch in whatever shell you work.\n> Run `dispatch completions -—help` to see instructions for a variety of popular shells.\n\n## Authorizing Yourself to Use It\n\nRun `dispatch login`, which will open a web browser and prompt you to authorize your Discord account with Dispatch.\n\nYup, that\'s it.\n\nONWARDS!\n\n## Creating Branches\n\n> warn\n> If you have not yet set up a Team and an application, please follow the steps in [Get Set Up](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/get-set-up)\n\nNow that we\'re set up to use the tool, let\'s make some branches! Branches, builds, and everything in between in Discord are tied to an application. To get one for your game, ask a Discord team member to hook you up!\n\nThen, head over to our [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/), click into that new application, and copy the `Client Id` at the top of the page, keeping it handy throughout this process. Client ID and "application id" are interchangeable phrases. For the rest of this documentation, we\'ll refer to it as application id.\n\nBack to your terminal, type:\n\n```\ndispatch branch create <application_id> <branch_name>\n```\n\nThis will create a named branch under that application id that can be pushed to. You can see your branches with:\n\n```\ndispatch branch list <application_id>\n```\n\n## Setting Up Our First Build\n\nIn order for Discord to understand what you\'re sending, you need to set up a config file for your game. This config file tells Discord which files to bundle together, how to run them, and other metadata to include. You should keep this file safe in your version control system of choice; that way, Discord is always up to date with whatever you\'ve got locally. You\'ll reference these manifests later when building your store pages, so that Discord knows what to download to someone\'s computer when they hit that Big Buy Button.\n\nLet\'s break an example `config.json` file down into pieces, and then put it together at the end.\n\n## Basic Information\n\n```js\n{\n  "application": {\n    "id": 467102538279999224,\n    "manifests": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is the top level of the config file. It has an `application` object at the top. `id` is your application id. `manifests` are the heart of this file, and offer a lot of customization for tagging and uploading data for the build. Let\'s jump into that now.\n\n## Labels, Platforms, and Local Roots\n\n```js\n{\n  "label": "my-awesome-game/windows",\n  "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n  "locales": [],\n  "local_root": "./game-files/windows",\n  "redistributables": [\n    "directx_june_2010"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWe\'re in the heart of a manifest now! `label` is the name you want to give an individual manifest/bundle of files. Make these easily identifiable so you can reference them later in your store page creation.\n\n`platforms` are the platforms for which the manifest is valid. Most simple configs, like our example, will use the same manifest for `win32` and `win64`, and then make other manifests for `osx` and `linux`. However, some older games may need specific configurations for 32bit and 64bit systems, and therefore need separate manifests.\n\n`locales` is an array of locales for which the manifest is valid; leaving it empty denotes it\'s valid for all locales. For example, your base game files will probably have an empty `locales` array, but you may other manifests for things like language packs defined for `es-ES` or `fr` or other locales.\n\n`local_root` is the relative path to the directory that contains the raw game files to upload for this manifest. This may be particularly useful if you have multiple manifests with different relative root directories, like:\n\n```json\n// Imaginary directory structure:\n// C:\\game\\binary\n// C:\\game\\langs\\en-US\n// C:\\game\\langes\\fr\n\n{\n  "manifests": [\n    {\n      "label": "game-files",\n      "local_root": "binary"\n    },\n    {\n      "label": "english-language-pack",\n      "local_root": "en-US"\n    },\n    {\n      "label": "french-language-pack",\n      "local_root": "fr"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThat way, you can `dispatch build push` from your actual root directory, but dispatch will be smart enough to separate the files properly.\n\n`redistributables` is an array of any redistributable packages your game may need to function, like a certain install of DirectX, or a Microsoft C++ redistributable. A list of valid values can be found in [Field Values](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/).\n\n## File Rules\n\n```js\n{\n  "file_rules": {\n    "mappings": [\n      {\n        "local_path": ".",\n        "install_path": "."\n      },\n      {\n        "local_path": "./languages/en-US/no-but-the-data-is-really-in-here/",\n        "install_path": "./english"\n      }\n    ],\n    "properties": [\n      {\n        "install_path": "save/*",\n        "attributes": ["user_data"]\n      }\n    ],\n    "exclusions": [\n      {\n        "local_path": "**/*.pdb"\n      },\n      {\n        "local_path": "**/*.verycoolfile"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFile rules is a special, and somewhat confusing, part of the manifest, but we\'ll get through it together! The `file_rules` object lets you:\n\n1. Specify the way in which files get installed on a user\'s computer\n2. Mark files as protected, so they don\'t get overwritten\n3. Exclude certain files from being uploaded\n\n`mappings` lets you tell Dispatch to download files to a certain place in the install directory on a user\'s machine, letting you create the folder structure you need. Your game build files may be tucked deep in a subdirectory on your machine, because who ever cleans up folder structures, but you can make sure it looks nice and clean for your players.\n\n`properties` allows you to mark properties on globs of files. In this case, marking a glob of files as `user_data` tells Dispatch not to touch these files in any way if it sees them; don\'t want that save data overwritten!\n\n`exclusions` also allow you to mark off globs of files. File globs here will not be uploaded by Dispatch on a build push. In the above example, debug files that match the `*.pdb` or `*.verycoolfile` patterns in any directory will be ignored.\n\n> warn\n> Dispatch supports [Rust globbing patterns](https://docs.rs/glob/0.2.11/glob/struct.Pattern.html).\n\n## Cloud Storage\n\n```js\n{\n  "storage": {\n    "sync": true,\n    "roots": [\n      {\n        "id": "my-save-files",\n        "paths": [\n          {\n            "platform": "windows",\n            "path": "${DOCUMENTS}/My Games/My Awesome Game/Saves"\n          },\n          {\n            "platform": "macos",\n            "path": "${DOCUMENTS}/Games/My Awesome Game/Saves"\n          }\n        ],\n        "patterns": ["**/*"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDiscord supports cloud saves! Let\'s learn how to use it! This piece of the manifest, `storage`, helps Discord support cloud saves for your game. When `sync` is set to `true`, Discord will look in the `paths` provided here for any files that match one of the `patterns`. If it finds any, it will sync them to the cloud, so your user will have access to them across machines.\n\nIf you are **not** using our [Storage Manager](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORAGE/) to manage your game\'s save files, make sure to outline your save paths and file glob patterns here.\n\nIf you **are** using the Storage Manager in the GameSDK, just set `sync` to `true` and omit the `roots` key.\n\n> danger\n> `id` must be a constant, immutable value once set. You can pick whatever you\'d like when first set, but ensure it does not change afterwards. Otherwise, Discord may incorrectly overwrite and/or delete users\' save data.\n\nWe support a number of filepath replacements/shorteners like `{$DOCUMENTS}`, so you can have something like `${SAVEDGAMES}/My Awesome Game/${USERID}` and create user-specific save files. No longer will you need to worry about your little brother overwriting your save file! For the full list of path replacements, see [Cloud Save Path Replacements](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/manifests-cloud-save-path-replacements).\n\nAs a side note, there may be a case where you might have multiple manifests that each have storage information defined. In the case that the two manifests define the same storage path but have _conflicting_ data, the source of truth will be the manifest that appears **later** in the array in the config file. So, if you have:\n\n```js\n{\n  "manifests": [\n    {\n      "label": "one",\n      "storage": {\n        "sync": true,\n        "roots": [\n          {\n            "id": "one",\n            "paths": [\n              {\n                "platform": "windows",\n                "path": "${HOME}"\n              }\n            ],\n            "patterns": ["**/*"]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      "label": "two",\n      "storage": {\n        "sync": true,\n        "roots": [\n          {\n            "id": "two",\n            "paths": [\n              {\n                "platform": "windows",\n                "path": "${HOME}"\n              }\n            ],\n            "patterns": ["**/*"]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThen, manifest `two` would be the source of truth in a data conflict. Wew, ok, good work. On to the next part!\n\n## Registry Keys and Install Scripts\n\n```js\n{\n  "install_scripts": [\n    {\n      "name": "SDB Compatibility",\n      "executable": "Install.bat",\n      "arguments": ["/silent"],\n      "requires_admin": true,\n      "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n      "completion_registry_key": {\n        "key": "Software\\\\My Game Company\\\\InstallScripts\\\\SDB-win32",\n        "value": 1\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  "registry_keys": [\n    {\n      "key": "Software\\\\My Game Company\\\\My Awesome Game\\\\FixAspctRatio",\n      "value": "1"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSome games may need specific registry keys set after installation, or might have some installation scripts that need to be run. If so, those can be set here!\n\nFor installation scripts, `name` is a user friendly name that Discord will surface to users when explaining what\'s happening during the installation process. `executable` is the name of the script that needs to be run. `arguments` is an array that takes any arguments that may need to be passed to the script. `requires_admin`, when marked `true`, will run the install scripts with admin privileges; for some Windows users, this may force a User Access Control security popup. You must also tell Discord the `completion_registry_key` of the scripts, so that we know not to try and run the script again if the given registry key is found on the user\'s machine.\n\n`registry_keys` is a simple array of key/value pairs that will be written to the user\'s computer\'s registry. By default, Discord will create these keys in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`. If your game requires registry keys in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`, they can be specified like:\n\n```js\n{\n  "key": "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\My Game Company\\\\My Awesome Game\\\\MagicFix",\n  "value": "1"\n}\n```\n\nDon\'t forget to the notice the double backward slashes in the path name!\n\n## Launch Options\n\n```js\n{\n  "launch_options": [\n    {\n      "name": "My Awesome Game",\n      "executable": "my-awesome-game.exe",\n      "arguments": [],\n      "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n      "working_dir": "important-files-here/"\n    },\n    {\n      "name": "My Awesome Map Editor",\n      "executable": "my-awesome-map-editor.exe",\n      "arguments": [],\n      "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n      "working_dir": "important-files-here/"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe last bit of the config file is the launch options for your game. This is where you should tell Discord which executables your game can launch. In most cases, you\'ll just have one object, which is the main executable for your game. However, in the case that your game may have multiple executables that users can launch, you can specify all of them here.\n\n> warn\n> The `name` field _must_ be unique for each launch option.\n\nWhen launching the game from their Game Library, players will be able to choose which executable is being launched, with the first option in the list as the default. So, for example, if your game comes with the game and a map editor, they\'ll have access to both without needing multiple entries in their library. Discord will smartly remember their choice for the future, but they\'ll always have the option to swap to a different one if they want.\n\nYou can also specify any arguments that need to be passed to your game on launch, like `--fullscreen` or `--console` or `--360-no-scope`.\n\nIf your game needs to have a specific working directly, you can also specify that here. Otherwise we\'ll default to the `content/` folder in the install directory.\n\n> danger\n> Currently, `executable` and `working_dir` are relative to the _install path_ on a user\'s machine, not your local root. This path is `${INSTALLDIR}/content/` unless otherwise specified in [File Rules](#DOCS_DISPATCH_BRANCHES_AND_BUILDS/file-rules).\n\n## All Together Now\n\nLet\'s see what one looks like all together!\n\n```js\n{\n  "application": {\n    "id": 467102538279999224,\n    "manifests": [\n      {\n        "label": "my-awesome-game/windows",\n        "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n        "locales": [],\n        "local_root": "./",\n        "file_rules": {\n          "mappings": [\n            {\n              "local_path": ".",\n              "install_path": "."\n            }\n          ],\n          "properties": [\n            {\n              "install_path": "save/*",\n              "attributes": ["user_data"]\n            }\n          ],\n          "exclusions": [\n            {\n              "local_path": "**/*.pdb"\n            },\n            {\n              "local_path": "**/*.verycoolfile"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        "storage": {\n          "sync": true,\n          "roots": [\n            {\n              "id": "my-save-files",\n              "paths": [\n                {\n                  "platform": "windows",\n                  "path": "${DOCUMENTS}/My Games/My Awesome Game/Saves"\n                },\n                {\n                  "platform": "macos",\n                  "path": "${DOCUMENTS}/Games/My Awesome Game/Saves"\n                }\n              ],\n              "patterns": ["**/*"]\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        "install_scripts": [\n          {\n            "name": "SDB Compatibility",\n            "executable": "Install.bat",\n            "arguments": ["/silent"],\n            "requires_admin": true,\n            "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n            "completion_registry_key": {\n              "key": "Software\\\\My Game Company\\\\InstallScripts\\\\SDB-win32",\n              "value": 1\n            }\n          }\n        ],\n        "registry_keys": [\n          {\n            "key": "Software\\\\My Game Company\\\\My Awesome Game\\\\FixAspctRatio",\n            "value": "1"\n          }\n        ],\n        "launch_options": [\n          {\n            "name": "My Awesome Game",\n            "executable": "my-awesome-game.exe",\n            "arguments": [],\n            "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n            "working_dir": "important-files-in-here/"\n          },\n          {\n            "name": "My Awesome Map Editor",\n            "executable": "my-awesome-map-editor.exe",\n            "arguments": [],\n            "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n            "working_dir": "important-files-in-here/"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt seems like a lot of lines to parse, but now you know what they all mean!\n\n## DRM\n\nYou can choose to add DRM to your game. Dispatch will wrap your executables and prevent a user from launching the game if they are not logged into Discord.\n\n> danger\n> This is a destructive operation. It will wrap your executable in place. It will not back up your executable. Make sure you have a backup somewhere else.\n\nIf you understand and agree to the above, run the following command on each of the executables you want to wrap.\n\n```\ndispatch build drm-wrap <application_id> <path_to_executable_to_wrap>\n```\n\n## Pushing Our First Build\n\nWe\'ve got all our files ready for processing; let\'s ship this baby!\n\n```\ndispatch build push <branch_id> <path_to_config> <path_to_files_to_upload>\n```\n\nYou\'ll see a bunch of request logging as it gets sent up to Discord—when it\'s done, you\'re greeted with a friendly completion message:\n\n```\n[2018-06-14][11:38:51][INFO] Pushed build. build_id=456889899375656960\n```\n\nTo double check that it\'s all ready for publishing, run:\n\n```\ndispatch build list <application_id> <branch_id>\n```\n\nYou\'ll see a table with the current status of your builds. Once the one you uploaded is marked as READY, you\'re good to publish it to the masses!\n\n## Publishing Our First Build\n\nOnce you\'re ready to make a build live, run:\n\n```\ndispatch build publish <application_id> <branch_id> <build_id>\n```\n\nTo make sure it worked, you can again run:\n\n```\ndispatch branch list <application_id>\n```\n\nAnd look for a `LIVE_BUILD_ID` under your application!\n\n## Downloading a Build for Testing\n\nNow that you\'ve got a build pushed and published, we should make sure that what you\'ve sent out into the world works as intended. You can download your published build on a given branch to your local machine with the command:\n\n```\ndispatch build update <application_id> <branch_id> <install_path> --platform <value> --locale <value>\n```\n\n`install_path` is any filepath on your local machine; this is where the files will be downloaded to. `--platform` and `--locale` are whatever values you set as valid platforms and locales in your config file for a given build. The default probably looks something like `win64` and `en-US`.\n\nHere\'s an example of the command with our info:\n\n```\ndispatch build update 467102538279999224 456889899375659999 C:\\my-game --platform win64 --locale en-US\n```\n\nNow you can run the executable for your game in that directory and make sure it works!\n\n## Patching\n\nIf you need to push out a patch or a new build, no problem! Just repeat the process:\n\n- Update your game files locally to whatever they need to be\n- Push your build again\n- Publish the build again\n- List your branches to make sure the new build is live\n\nDiscord will do some magic in the background to diff your files, ensuring that your players only have to download the changes they need and letting them do it quickly so they can get back in the game. Or, really, without them even needing to know there _was_ a patch! Your players will automatically download your latest and greatest stuff, and quickly!\n\nIf you have your own patcher and do not want Discord to handle patching, set `"should_patch": false` in the application configuration. If `should_patch` is false, Discord will install the game and never patch, even if you update your game. On uninstall, Discord will delete the entire directory, including saves and user data.\n\n```js\n{\n  "application": {\n    "id": 467102538279999224,\n    "should_patch": false,\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow that you\'ve got a game in the system, let\'s [create a store page](#DOCS_DISPATCH_MANAGING_STORE_LISTINGS) for it!\n'},1968:function(e,n){e.exports="# Dispatch and You\n\nIf you're distributing a game on Discord, you'll need to send us the files! We quickly learned that email has a file size limit, and we ran out of carrier pigeons. Don't ask. Very touchy subject.\n\nIn light of those learnings, we built Dispatch! Great name, isn't it? _Dis_-patch? Anyway, Dispatch is your all-in-one uploader tool to get your builds, artwork, patches, DLC, and anything else onto Discord's servers. It's fast, easy to use, and I've been assured by our engineers that it's made of 100% farm-raised, cage-free, grass-fed code.\n\nIf you are looking to update your store page, head on over to our handy dandy [Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers). It has all the tools you need to make changes to your store page for your game. During the beta period, if you need access to your store page, let a member of the Discord team know, and we'll help you out.\n\nLet's get you pointed in the right direction; follow this little Table of Contents to start, and you'll be a pro with this tool faster than you can say \"But wait I don't actually know what a terminal is.\"\n\n1.

[Pre-defined Field Values](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/)\n\n> info\n> To use Dispatch, you will need an application id for your game.

We understand the value of getting feedback early and often and involving your community early on. That's why we've built some awesome alpha and beta testing functionality for you!\n\n## Beta Entitlements\n\nAs you develop your game, you'll constantly be making improvements. You want real-time feedback from players, and there's no better place for that than Discord. In the past, players would need to dig through menus to find out how to unlock test branches, as well as remembering secret passwords _and_ typing them in correctly. Was that an `I` or an `l`? `O` or `0`?\n\nOne of the cool features of [Store Channels](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_SPECIAL_CHANNELS/store-channels) is their ability to grant a Beta Entitlement for your game. That means that while you keep your master branch safe and sound, users can test on `beta-branch-please-ignore-bugs` in an isolated test environment.\n\n> info\n> To learn more about creating branches, start with [Dispatch and You](#DOCS_DISPATCH_DISPATCH_AND_YOU/).\n\nWhen you create a store channel in your server, you'll be prompted with a choice to make it a Beta channel. That will allow you to grant users entitlement to the non-master branch of your game when visiting the store page. When your beta period is over and your game is ready for release and purchase, you can brick/delete these branches if you choose, and prompt users to get the full game by putting up a new store channel that's not Beta.\n\n> warn\n> Beta branches cannot be sold. If a user has access to a store channel for a beta entitlement, they will be able to claim it for free.\n\n## Role-Based Entitlement\n\nSo, you've started getting a bunch of fans into your server. Hundreds, thousands, millions! Uh, if you hit millions, let us know. Within your hordes of adoring fans lies your Trusted Testing Group (tm), the best of the best when it comes to feedback. Maybe you want to give them access to a special `insider-only-private-beta` branch of your game. You can, with role-based entitlement!\n\nStore channels in Discord are just like any other channel in that they can have a set of permissions applied to them. What is special about them is that if they are set as a Beta branch, entitlement to that branch is tied to having permissions to view the channel. So, all your testers with a `Beta Tester` role, for example, will be able to get entitlement to the `insider-only-private-beta` branch. And, if they are later removed from that role, entitlement from that branch will be removed.\n\nA scenario might look like this: you create a Beta store channel. Only users with role `Awesome Tester` can view it. Player A is an `Awesome Tester`. They can view the channel and get entitlement to the beta branch. Player A becomes inactive; you remove them from the `Awesome Tester` role. Player A loses entitlement to `insider-only-private-beta`\n\n> danger\n> Role-based entitlement will only work if you use Discord's DRM, which is a simple entitlement check. You can do that with the Dispatch command [`dispatch build drm-wrap`](#DOCS_DISPATCH_LIST_OF_COMMANDS/build-drmwrap) or by calling [`ApplicationManager.ValidateOrExit()`](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/validateorexit). Otherwise, Discord will not check the user's entitlement when the game starts.\n\nRole-based entitlements help keep your beta community active and interactive, while also providing a way to reward your biggest fans with secret access to special things.\n\n## Gift Codes\n\nIf you want to push out access to your game at scale, rather than inviting people into your server and giving them a role, you can create gift codes in the Developer Portal! Gift codes are like game keys on other platforms that you might be familiar with, with an added bonus: the ability to specify the entitlement time window. That means that you can create codes for your game to give to everyone, but they won't be able to play until the `VALID FROM` date. Similarly, you can set a `VALID UNTIL` date on all your gift codes if you want the entitlements to expire after a certain time, removing access from players.\n\nNote that the `VALID UNTIL` date will not remove the game from the user's library, but they will no longer be able to launch it.\n\nUp to 10,000 gift codes can be created at a time. When you go to create gift codes, you'll notice there are a few fields for you to fill out. Here's what they mean:\n\n![](gift-code-creation.png)\n\n- SKU: the SKU that you want the user to get\n- Branch: the branch of your game you want the user to get\n- Valid From: the start date at which the entitlement is valid\n- Valid Until: the date at which the entitlement is no longer valid\n- Amount: the number of codes you want to create (up to 10,000 per batch)\n- Description: a short description of why you made the codes, so you remember!\n\nOnce you've made your codes, you can download the `.csv` that has them all in it, and distribute them however you'd like!\n"},1972:function(e,n){e.exports="# How to Get Your Game on Discord\n\nWelcome, adventurer! If you're here, you want to find out how to get your game up and running on Discord and learn about our awesome Server Commerce features. You've come to the right place, so let's get started.\n\n## Get the Band Back Together\n\nFirst things first: it's time to make a Team. Your dream team of artists, writers, engineers, designers, all working on the beautiful creation of Your Game. Build your dream team with these steps:\n\n1. Create a new Team at [https://discordapp.com/developers/teams](https://discordapp.com/developers/teams)\n2. Invite people!\n\nYou've now passed the first test with flying colors!\n\n## Apps and Games\n\nThroughout this process, we'll reference your \"app\". An app, or application, is an entity on Discord that represents something you've built: a bot, an OAuth2 app, or in this case your game. We need to make an app for your game:\n\n1. Create a new app at [https://discordapp.com/developers/applications](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)\n2. When doing so, make sure you select your team from the `Team` dropdown\n\n> info\n> All apps on Discord for games must be owned by a team. If you accidentally made a personal app, you can transfer it to a team at any time by hitting the `Transfer App to Team` button within the app.\n\nYou're now looking at a blank slate of creativity. Give your game a pretty icon and exciting description here. Next, click on `Server Commerce Checklist` in the sidebar, and we'll get to the good stuff.\n\n## Join the Club\n\nFrom here on forward, we'll be managing settings that tie directly to your game and its presence on Discord. We want to make sure that we're laser-focused on making the best experience possible for game developers, so we ask that you pay our Application License Fee in order to get access to our store tools, which let you:\n\n- make store pages for your game directly in your server\n- create a news channel, in which you can publish announce to all players of your game on Discord\n- run alpha and beta tests for your game, using the magic of channel permissions to create role-based page access\n- apply for approval, letting you start making money\n\nNow that we've weeded out the trolls, let's get your server up and running with some fancy new features!\n\n## Your Server - Your Kingdom\n\nYou're now looking at a checklist with a bunch of items and a prompt to select a server. Your Application License Fee entitles you to the following features in your server:\n\n- store channel creation\n- news channel creation\n- alpha and beta testing\n\nSelect the server that you wish to grant these features, confirm to be double-extra-super-sure, and poof! You can now create channels for both news and store pages in your server. To learn more about store page channels, read [Store Channels](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_SPECIAL_CHANNELS/store-channels). To learn more about news channels, read [News Channels](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_SPECIAL_CHANNELS/news-channels). To learn about alpha and beta testing, read [Alpha and Beta Testing](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_ALPHA_AND_BETA_TESTING/)\n(you get the gist).\n\nNow, what do you do next? You start building! Build your community, make your game, invite testers into your server to get hype! Now is a great time to get familiar with all the tools at your disposal like:\n\n- [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications), your one-stop-game-management-shop\n- [The Discord Game SDK](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/), a spellbook full of useful game dev incantations including Discord's crystal-clear voice chat\n- [Dispatch](#DOCS_DISPATCH_DISPATCH_AND_YOU/), Discord's game patcher and downloader that's so fast, you'll swear it's magic\n\nTo guide you through this process to success, you can follow that handy checklist. It'll tell you the steps you need to complete, show you where and how to do them, and give you a blissful sense of satisfaction as the green check marks pile up.\n\nThe next and final step in your on-boarding journey is getting approved. Once approved, you'll be able to start making money, and you'll unlock a ton of cool server customization features to make your kingdom cozy for your players.\n\n## Testing Your Game\n\nAs you go through the process of building your game and getting it ready for release on Discord, you'll want to be able to test it! One way to do so is to utilize Beta Store channels, which you can learn more about here: [Alpha and Beta Testing](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_ALPHA_AND_BETA_TESTING/).\n\nIf you are on the Team that owns the game, you can also use another special system for testing that we call Application Test Mode. Test Mode allows you to purchase unavailable, unlisted SKUs for free, making it helpful for testing IAP flows. It also automatically makes every branch of your game show up in your Library when Test Mode is turned on. You can read more here: [Application Test Mode](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORE/application-test-mode).\n\n## Getting Approved\n\nYour game looks wonderful. You've got a beautiful store page, and awesome game, and an eager community. It's time to get approved and plant your flag. Note that if your game is in an alpha or beta state, or you're interesting in Early Access, you are welcome to apply for approval whenever you are ready. Your game doesn't need to be the finished 1.0 version; give us something you'd feel comfortable giving to your players.\n\nOnce you've completed all the items on your checklist, the `Get Approved` button will unlock. Once you submit for approval, Discord will take a look at the following things:\n\n- your game, to ensure that it runs properly\n- your store pages, to provide helpful guidance in putting your best foot forward\n- your server, to make sure you're abiding by our [Community Guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines)\n\nIf we need to see some changes, you'll receive an email directing you on your steps to success. Otherwise, you'll get **APPROVED!!!!!!!!!!** What's that mean? It means you can start charging for your game and making money! Don't spend it all in one place. Or do. Treat yourself.\n\n## Available vs Store Page Published\n\nNow that you've been approved, there's a couple new toggles to flip in the Developer Portal: `Available`, and `Store Page Published`.\n\n![](available-published.png)\n\n`Available` means that your game is now available for normal purchase/distribution; your non-beta store channel will no longer say `Coming soon!` when this is toggled, and users will be able to get your game.\n\n> danger\n> Toggling your SKU as `Available` will make it available for purchase; make sure your price is set properly!\n\nIf you no longer wish to make your SKU available for sale, you can again mark it unavailable. This will not remove it from users' libraries; it just stops new users from purchasing it.\n\n`Store Page Published` will do...well, what it says! Though your store page is always visible from within the channel in your server, there are other things that require you to explicitly mark your page viewable from outside that context, like gift code embeds for your game.\n\nTL;DR - When you're ready to distribute your game after getting approved, turn those two toggles on.\n\n## Getting Verified and Discovered\n\nApart from being approved, you can also get your server Verified. Getting verified means your server will get that oh-so-exclusive checkmark, to let people know you're the legit home for your game. It also means you'll show up in [Server Discovery](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311-Server-Discovery) so that players can search for your game or community to join you in your server. It _also also_ unlocks a sweet customizable [Server Banner](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_VANITY_PERKS/server-banner-background) to fly over your kingdom.\n\nTo get verified, head on over to our [Verification page](https://discordapp.com/verification) and fill out the form at the bottom.\n\n## Make Good Decisions\n\nYour game is off and running, and we couldn't be more proud. As it flourishes and your playerbase grows, keep an eye on your analytics, which you can find within your app. They'll give you important insight like revenue data, acquisitions funnels, and player retention to help you make informed decision about your game's lifecycle. Check out our [Analytics Help Article](https://support-dev.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024852152) to learn more about how to read all those charts, and how to do things like [Conversion Tracking with UTM Links](https://support-dev.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025153051-How-to-track-conversions-with-UTM-links).\n\n## What Comes Next\n\nYour game's success is in your own hands now. Continue to build your community and keep them informed with news. Consider integrating more deeply with Discord to deliver cool features to your players; we recommend [Rich Presence Game Invites](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/). They feel like magic. Drop new content by creating DLC and IAP for your game, run fun tournaments based on [HypeSquad Membership](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_USERS/current-user-has-flag), give something cool to [Discord Nitro Subscribers](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_USERS/get-current-user-premium-status) because they're awesome. Or maybe, just maybe, think about your next upcoming game?\n\nWe'd love to help you with that one, too.\n\n-- Discord <3\n"},1973:function(e,n){e.exports="# Special Channels\n\nPart of the Magic Toolbox of Game Distribution includes two new special channel types: store channels and news channels. Store channels let you show off your hand-crafted store pages in your server; news channels let you publish beautiful news embeds directly to the Activity Feeds of Discord users who play your game. Let's learn how to use them!\n\n## Store Channels\n\nOne of the new flagship features of Verified Servers and Game Servers are the ability to host your store pages directly in your server. We know that community is everything for games, and that your server is already the place where your community lives. Rather than the friction and impersonality of traditional storefronts, you can let your fans find your game in the cozy comfort of their home (your server!).\n\nIn order to create a store channel for your game, you'll need to make sure you've followed [the Walkthrough](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_HOW_TO_GET_YOUR_GAME_ON_DISCORD/) up to `Getting Approved`. If you've done that, you'll see in your server that you can create a new channel type: `Store`.\n\n![](create-store-channel.png)\n\nAlong with entering a name for your new channel, you'll be prompted to select an application. This should be the app you created when you started; it's the one linked to your server. After selecting your app, you'll be prompted to select a SKU. What's a SKU? A SKU is simply a thing that a user can buy. This is most likely your game (a SKU of type `Game`), but could also be `IAP`, `DLC`, or a `Bundle`.\n\nYou can create SKUs to put up for sale by going to your app and selecting `SKU Management`.\n\n![](sku-management.png)\n\nOnce you select your SKU and create your channel...it's there! You now have a store channel in your server! If you want, you can set permissions on this channel like any channel in a server to restrict who can see it. Learn more about that by reading [Alpha and Beta Testing](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_ALPHA_AND_BETA_TESTING/).\n\n## News Channels\n\n> warn\n> News channels are currently in beta and are subject to change.\n\nThe Activity Feed is the home page of Discord - where millions of users go to get news about their favorite games, see what their friends are playing, and jump into action with our universal launcher.\n\nAs part of our ongoing effort to help you build your game community, we've now added the ability for you to publish news from your server directly to the Activity Feed. **This means that your content updates and patch notes can now reach all users on Discord who play your game, not just the users who are in your server!**\n\nThis is currently a beta feature and is subject to change based on user feedback and testing.\n\n### Guidelines\n\nWith great power, come great responsibility - therefore, we've got some guidelines for you to follow:\n\n- PC-only news and updates are preferred (unless your game is console or mobile-only).\n- Content must be directly relevant to the game (no cross promotion of other games unless its in the same franchise).\n- No excessively sexual or violent content.\n- No content that is purely an advertisement, please. This is not the place for it.\n\nAll content must also abide by our [Community Guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines).\n\n### How to Enable News Channels\n\nIn order to create a news channel for your game, you'll need to make sure you've followed [the Walkthrough](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_HOW_TO_GET_YOUR_GAME_ON_DISCORD/) up to `Getting Approved`. If you already have a text channel in which you post game announcements, you can turn it into a news channel by doing the following:\n\n1. Hover over the channel name and click on the settings cog icon to go into Channel Settings.\n2. Set channel as News Channel.\n\nOtherwise:\n\n1. In the channel list, hover over the channel category where you want your News channel to live and hit the + icon to Create a Channel.\n2. Select News as the channel type, and enter a channel name.\n3. Click Create Channel.\n\nTada! Anytime you post an announcement with a link, you can now hover over the message and click \"Publish\" to publish the news to the Activity Feeds of all users who play your game. Make sure to set permissions properly so that only people who properly represent your game can send messages in that channel. All users who have permission to send messages in the channel will be able to publish news to the Activity Feed.\n\nYou can now publish all the exciting updates about your game directly to the Activity Feed of your players!\n\n## Special Channels and Lurker Mode\n\nThese two types of special Discord channels have another special property that we call `lurkability`. \"Lurker Mode\" is a feature that we've been experimenting with throughout Discord; it allows users to read public channels in a server without _actually_ joining the server. It also allows users to look at these channels without being logged in to Discord.\n\n> info\n> Users viewing channels in Lurker Mode will not be able to send messages in those channels. They'll be prompted to log in and join the server if they want to chat.\n\nLurker Mode is automatically enabled for news and store channels in your server. When someone accepts a server invite that links to a news or store channel, they'll be viewing in \"Lurker Mode\".\n\nWe know that your server and community are at the heart of your game's success on Discord. Having Discord users see your news and store pages in the context of your server will help drive more members to your community and help you grow that awesome fanbase for your game.\n"},1974:function(e,n){e.exports="# Vanity Perks\n\nIf you're a Verified Server on Discord, you get access to a suite of server customization features to help make your server stand out and feel all cozy and comfortable for your players. We've outline all those features below for you, including some best practices to help you put your best foot forward.\n\n> info\n> There are many more great features to be documented here! Keep checking back for more info about features and best practices.\n\n## Server Banner Background\n\nThe Server Banner Background is a new addition to the server customization toolbox. Along with the oh-so-coveted Verified Check Mark, you can now show off a banner at the top of the channel list in your server. This can be managed in your server settings in the Discord app.\n\nWe like to continually improve and polish the features we release and have decided to retire the Server Banner Background (RIP 2019 - 2019) and introduce a new version of the server banner called Server Banner Background (same name, just like the soft reboot of the 1980’s movie Total Recall).\n\n#### Previous Design\n\nThe first iteration fo the banner background had the title at the bottom of the image. In the newest version of the design, we’ve moved the name of the server back to the top. In order to help with this change, we had the design team put together some guidelines for best results.\n\n![](previous-new-server-background.png)\n\n#### Best Practices\n\n_Upload an image that's at least 960x540 pixels in a 16:9 aspect ratio._ Have a 1920x1080 image handy? Upload that and we'll automatically resize it for you.\n\n_Keep the top 48px of the image fairly simple and free of any busy imagery._ We'd suggest uploading an image without a logo or text in it. This way, the title of your server will be easy to read.\n\n![](server-banner-margin-top.png)\n\n_Use an image that represents your game or brand._ Key art, stills of a character, or subtle background art work well here. Here's a great example from our good friend Master Chief:\n\n![](server-banner-example.png)\n\nYou did it! Lookin' good there.\n"},1975:function(e,n){e.exports='# Activities\n\n> info\n> Need help with the SDK?

This might be a custom protocol, like `my-awesome-game://`, or a path to an executable. It also supports any lauch parameters that may be needed, like `game.exe --full-screen --no-hax`.\n\nOn macOS, due to the way Discord registers executables, your game needs to be bundled for this command to work. That means it should be a `.app`.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type   | description             |\n| ------- | ------ | ----------------------- |\n| command | string | the command to register |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nactivityManager.RegisterCommand("my-awesome-game://run --full-screen");\n```\n\n## RegisterSteam\n\nUsed if you are distributing this SDK on Steam.

Applications\n\n> info\n> Need help with the SDK? Talk to us at [dis.gd/devsupport](https://dis.gd/devsupport)\n\nMany games run their own backend servers for things like user authentication. If one of those many games is yours, then we\'ve got something for you! This manager gives you access to a bearer token for the currently connected Discord user, which you can send off to your server to do user authentication.\n\nThis token is also useful for retrieving information about the connected user\'s account. Check out our [OAuth2 documentation](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) for more information.\n\nThese bearer tokens are good for seven days, after which they will expire. When a user reconnects to your game, and is online and connected to the internet, they\'ll receive a new token that you can grab.\n\nThis manager also includes a couple useful helper functions, like getting the locale in which the user has chosen to use their Discord client, and knowing which game branch the game is running on. More about branches in the Dispatch CLI tool section of the documentation.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### OAuth2Token Struct\n\n| name        | type   | description                                                                                     |\n| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| AccessToken | string | a bearer token for the current user                                                             |\n| Scopes      | string | a list of oauth2 scopes as a single string, delineated by spaces like `"identify rpc gdm.join"` |\n| Expires     | Int64  | the timestamp at which the token expires                                                        |\n\n###### SignedAppTicket Struct\n\n| name           | type                                                                                                                     | description                                              |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| application_id | Int64                                                                                                                    | the application id for the ticket                        |\n| user           | [User](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_USER/data-models-user-struct)                                                                      | the user for the ticket                                  |\n| entitlements   | list of partial [Entitlements](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORE/data-models-entitlement-struct) structs that contain just the SKU id | the list of the user\'s entitlements for this application |\n| timestamp      | string                                                                                                                   | the ISO 8601 timestamp for the ticket                    |\n\n## GetCurrentLocale\n\n> info\n> Value from environment variable `DISCORD_CURRENT_LOCALE`\n\nGet\'s the locale the current user has Discord set to.\n\nReturns a `string`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar locale = applicationManager.GetCurrentLocale();\nConsole.WriteLine("This user\'s language is {0}", locale);\n```\n\n## GetCurrentBranch\n\n> info\n> Value from environment variable `DISCORD_CURRENT_BRANCH`\n\nGet the name of pushed branch on which the game is running.

If your game was launched from Discord and you call this function, you will automatically receive the token. If the game was _not_ launched from Discord and this method is called, Discord will focus itself and prompt the user for authorization.\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` and a `ref Discord.OAuth2Token` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\napplicationManager.GetOAuth2Token((Discord.Result result, ref Discord.OAuth2Token token) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Token for the user: {0}.

Something went wrong, closing game...");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## GetTicket\n\n###### Current Version\n\n| version | status  |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| 2       | current |\n\nGet the signed app ticket for the current user. The structure of the ticket is: `version.signature.base64encodedjson`, so you should split the string by the `.` character. Ensure that the `version` matches the current version. The `signature` is used to verify the ticket using the libsodium library of your choice, and the `base64encodedjson` is what you can transform after verification. It contains:\n\n- the application id tied to the ticket\n- the user\'s user id\n- a timestamp for the ticket\n- the list of the user\'s [entitlements](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORE/data-models-entitlement-struct) for the application id\n\nThese values can be accessed by transforming the string into a [SignedAppTicket](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/data-models-signedappticket-struct) with your application\'s private key. The ticket is signed using [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) which should be available for any programming language. Here\'s a [list of available libraries](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/bindings_for_other_languages).\n\nNote that both the public key you receive from Discord and the signature within the app ticket from the SDK are both in hex, and will need to be converted to `byte[]` before use with libsodium.\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` and `ref string` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\n// Handle serialization however works best for you\n// This is just an easy example\n[Serializable]\npublic class SignedAppTicket\n{\n  public long application_id;\n  public Discord.User user;\n  public List<Discord.Entitlement> entitlements;\n  public string timestamp;\n}\n\npublic void DoTheThing()\n{\n  // This example is using the libsodium-net library\n  // https://github.com/adamcaudill/libsodium-net\n  var appManager = discord.GetApplicationManager();\n  var MY_PUBLIC_KEY = "460cab5f2237b71e3c2c06bzze217f4f68d55db16dae672bdfb6618235589999";\n  var MY_SKU_ID = "492432195219099999";\n\n  // Get the ticket\n  appManager.GetTicket((Discord.Result res, ref string ticket) =>\n  {\n    // Split the ticket into its parts\n    var parts = ticket.Split(\'.\');\n\n    // Ensure the version matches\n    if(parts[0] == "2")\n    {\n      // Verify the signature\n      // Your public key will be given to you by Discord\n      if (Sodium.PublicKeyAuth.VerifyDetached(HexToByte(parts[1]), System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(parts[2]), HexToByte(MY_PUBLIC_KEY)))\n      {\n        // If valid, decode the string\n        var byteData = Convert.FromBase64String(parts[2]);\n        var json = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(byteData);\n\n        // Deserialize it into the ticket object\n        var myTicket = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<SignedAppTicket>(json);\n\n        // Check for entitlement to the SKU!\n        if (myTicket.entitlements.Any(x => x.SkuId == MY_SKU_ID))\n        {\n          Console.WriteLine("User has entitlement to your game");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n          Console.WriteLine("Not entitled");\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n}\n\npublic byte[] HexToByte(string hex)\n{\n  byte[] data = new byte[hex.Length / 2];\n  for (int i = 0; i < hex.Length; i +=2)\n  {\n    data[i / 2] = Convert.ToByte(hex.Substring(i, 2), 16);\n  }\n  return data;\n}\n```\n\n## Example: Get OAuth2 Token\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\nvar appManager = discord.GetApplicationManager();\n\n// Retrieve the token\nappManager.GetOAuth2Token((Discord.Result result, ref Discord.OAuth2Token token) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine(token.AccessToken);\n\n  // Now send that token off to your server to do your own validation!\n})\n```\n'},1977:function(e,n){e.exports="# Discord\n\n> info\n> Need help with the SDK? Talk to us at [dis.gd/devsupport](https://dis.gd/devsupport)\n\nMaking a game? Need a whole bunch of fancy APIs to help make it great and your players' lives a breeze? Look no further! The Discord GameSDK is an easy drop-in SDK to help you manage all the hard things that come with making a game. Well, all the hards things about coding it at least. Interpersonal communication skills are on you (have you heard of this cool chat app called Discord?).\n\nOK, cool, so how's it work?\n\n## General Structure\n\nAt a high level, the Discord GameSDK has a class, `Discord`. This class is in charge of the creation of a few \"manager\" sub-classes. They are:\n\n- `ActivityManager` - for Rich Presence and game invites\n- `RelationshipManager` - for users' social relationships across Discord, including friends list\n- `ImageManager` - for getting data about images on Discord, like user avatars or chat images\n- `UserManager` - for fetching user data for a given id and the current user\n- `LobbyManager` - for multiplayer lobbies\n- `NetworkManager` - for all your networking layer needs\n- `ApplicationManager` - for retrieving a user's OAuth2 bearer token, locale, and current game branch\n- `StorageManager` - for saving game data to the disk and the cloud\n- `OverlayManager` - for interacting with Discord's built-in overlay\n\nEach one of these managers contain a number of methods and events used to interact with Discord in the context of the manager. For example, `RelationshipManager` has a function called `Filter()`, which lets you pare down a user's inter-Discord relationships based on a boolean condition, like being friends!\n\n## Functions in the SDK\n\nMost functions in the Discord GameSDK, uh, _function_ in a similar way. They take whatever parameters are required for the function to do its job—a user id, the requested size for an image, etc.—and a callback by means of a function pointer. That callback is fired when the function completes its work, letting you handle events without worrying about piping asynchronously-returned data to the right context.\n\nSome functions behave with a normal return behavior; e.g. `RelationshipManager.Count()` just returns the number directly. Don't worry, it's outlined in the docs.\n\nA quick example with our C# binding:\n\n```c#\nvar userManager = discord.GetUserManager();\n\n// Return via callback\nuserManager.GetUser(290926444748734465, (Discord.Result result, ref Discord.User otherUser) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine(otherUser.Username);\n    Console.WriteLine(otherUser.Id);\n  }\n});\n\n// Return normally\nvar currentUser = userManager.GetCurrentUser();\nConsole.WriteLine(currentUser.Id);\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nDiscord passes a number of environment variables down to the SDK. These are accessed by various methods in the SDK and can be changed for local testing by changing the value in your local environment.\n\n###### SDK Environment Variables\n\n| name                   | method                                                                                  | description                                                                                                          |\n| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID    | [Local Testing](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/testing-with-two-clients)              | the locally running instance of Discord to connect to; allows you to choose between multiple locally running clients |\n| DISCORD_ACCESS_TOKEN   | [ApplicationManager.GetOAuth2Token()](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/get-oauth2-token)     | the connected user's bearer token                                                                                    |\n| DISCORD_CURRENT_LOCALE | [ApplicationManager.GetCurrentLocale](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/get-current-locale)   | the language that Discord is in for the connected user                                                               |\n| DISCORD_CURRENT_BRANCH | [ApplicationManager.GetCurrentBranch()](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/get-current-branch) | the branch of the running application that the user has launched                                                     |\n| DISCORD_STORAGE_PATH   | [StorageManager.GetPath()](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORAGE/get-path)                             | the path to which Discord will save files if you're using the StorageManager                                         |\n\n## Error Handling\n\nDebugging is a pain, so before we get into the meat of the SDK, we want to make sure you're prepared for when things go awry. Within the Discord core is a function called `SetLogHook()`. It takes a `level`, which is minimum level of log message you want to listen to, and a callback function:\n\n```cs\npublic void LogProblemsFunction(LogLevel level, string message)\n{\n  Console.WriteLine(\"Discord:{0} - {1}\", level, message);\n}\n\ndiscord.SetLogHook(Discord.LogLevel.Debug, LogProblemFunctions);\n```\n\nYou should begin your integration by setting up this callback to help you debug. Helpfully, if you put a breakpoint inside the callback function you register here, you'll be able to see the stack trace for errors you run into (as long as they fail synchronously). Take the guess work out of debugging, or hey, ignore any and all logging by setting a callback that does nothing. We're not here to judge.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### Result Enum\n\n| value               | description                                                                    |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Ok                  | everything is good                                                             |\n| ServiceUnavailable  | Discord isn't working                                                          |\n| InvalidVersion      | the SDK version may be outdated                                                |\n| LockFailed          | an internal error on transactional operations                                  |\n| InternalError       | something on our side went wrong                                               |\n| InvalidPayload      | the data you sent didn't match what we expect                                  |\n| InvalidCommand      | that's not a thing you can do                                                  |\n| InvalidPermissions  | you aren't authorized to do that                                               |\n| NotFetched          | couldn't fetch what you wanted                                                 |\n| NotFound            | what you're looking for doesn't exist                                          |\n| Conflict            | user already has a network connection open on that channel                     |\n| InvalidSecret       | activity secrets must be unique and not match party id                         |\n| InvalidJoinRequest  | join request for that user does not exist                                      |\n| NoEligibleActivity  | you accidentally set an `ApplicationId` in your `UpdateActivity()` payload     |\n| InvalidInvite       | your game invite is no longer valid                                            |\n| NotAuthenticated    | the internal auth call failed for the user, and you can't do this              |\n| InvalidAccessToken  | the user's bearer token is invalid                                             |\n| ApplicationMismatch | access token belongs to another application                                    |\n| InvalidDataUrl      | something internally went wrong fetching image data                            |\n| InvalidBase64       | not valid Base64 data                                                          |\n| NotFiltered         | you're trying to access the list before creating a stable list with `Filter()` |\n| LobbyFull           | the lobby is full                                                              |\n| InvalidLobbySecret  | the secret you're using to connect is wrong                                    |\n| InvalidFilename     | file name is too long                                                          |\n| InvalidFileSize     | file is too large                                                              |\n| InvalidEntitlement  | the user does not have the right entitlement for this game                     |\n| NotInstalled        | Discord is not installed                                                       |\n| NotRunning          | Discord is not running                                                         |\n\n###### LogLevel Enum\n\n| value   | description                    |\n| ------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Error   | Log only errors                |\n| Warning | Log warnings and errors        |\n| Info    | Log info, warnings, and errors |\n| Debug   | Log _all_ the things!          |\n\n###### CreateFlags Enum\n\n| value            | description                                                         |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Default          | Requires Discord to be running to play the game                     |\n| NoRequireDiscord | Does not require Discord to be running, use this on other platforms |\n\n## Create\n\nCreates an instance of Discord to initialize the SDK.

Talk to us at [dis.gd/devsupport](https://dis.gd/devsupport)\n\nLooking to integrate multiplayer into your game? Lobbies are a great way to organize players into contexts to play together. This manager works hand in hand with the networking layer of our SDK to make multiplayer integrations a breeze by:\n\n- Creating, managing, and joining lobbies\n- Matchmaking users based on lobby metadata, like ELO\n- Getting and setting arbitrary metadata on lobbies and lobby members\n\nLobbies in Discord work in one of two ways. By using calls from the SDK, lobbies are effectively "owned" by the user who\'s client creates the lobby. Someone boots up the game, hits your "Create Lobby" button, and their game client calls `LobbyManager.CreateLobby()` from the Discord SDK.\n\nThere is also another way to create and "own" lobbies with which the source of truth can be your own server. These SDK functions calls map to API endpoints that are exposed in Discord\'s HTTP API. In lieu of creating and managing lobbies in the SDK, you can call those endpoints directly with a token for your application and take care of it all on some far-away, totally secure server. Let\'s go over the SDK first.\n\n## The SDK Way\n\nIn order to ensure that Discord lobbies are consistent for all players, this manager works with "transactions". A `LobbyTransaction` is needed to set lobby properties, like capacity. A `MemberTransaction` is needed to set lobby member properties, like metadata.\n\nTo update a user or a lobby, create or get a transaction for that resource, call the needed methods on it, and then pass it to the `Create()` or `Update()` methods. When passed to a `Create()` or `Update()` method, the transaction objected is consumed. So, if you want to do another `Create()` or `Update()`, you need to get a new transaction.\n\n###### Example: Creating a Lobby\n\n```cs\nvar lobbyManager = discord.GetLobbyManager();\n\n// Create the transaction\nvar txn = LobbyManager.CreateLobbyTransaction();\n\n// Set lobby information\ntxn.SetCapacity(6);\ntxn.SetType(Discord.LobbyType.Public);\ntxn.SetMetadata("a", "123");\n\n// Create it!\nlobbyManager.CreateLobby(txn, (result, lobby) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("lobby {0} created with secret {1}", lobby.Id, lobby.Secret);\n\n  // We want to update the capacity of the lobby\n  // So we get a new transaction for the lobby\n  var newTxn = lobbyManager.GetLobbyUpdateTransaction(lobby.id);\n  newTxn.SetCapacity(5);\n\n  lobbyManager.UpdateLobby(lobby.id, newTxn, (result, newLobby) =>\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("lobby {0} updated", newLobby.Id);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### LobbyType Enum\n\n| name    | value |\n| ------- | ----- |\n| Private | 1     |\n| Public

Lobbies that meet the criteria are then globally filtered, and can be accessed via iteration with `LobbyCount()` and `GetLobbyId()`. The callback fires when the list of lobbies is stable and ready for iteration.\n\nYou do not necessarily need to access the filtered lobbies within the context of the result callback, but it may make it easier for the sake of asynchronous timing.\n\nReturns `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type        | description         |\n| ------ | ----------- | ------------------- |\n| search | LobbySearch | the search criteria |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar search = lobbyManger.GetSearchQuery();\nsearch.Filter("metadata.matchmaking_rating", LobbySearchComparison.GreaterThan, LobbySearchCast.Number, "455");\nsearch.Sort("metadata.matchmaking_rating", LobbySearchCast.Number, "456");\nsearch.Limit(10);\nlobbyManger.Search(search, (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    var count = lobbyManager.LobbyCount();\n    Console.WriteLine("There are {0} lobbies that match your search criteria", count);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## LobbyCount\n\nGet the number of lobbies that match the search.\n\nReturns `Int32`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManger.Search(search, () =>\n{\n  var count = lobbyManager.LobbyCount();\n  Console.WriteLine("There are {0} lobbies that match your search criteria", count);\n});\n```\n\n## GetLobbyId\n\nReturns the id for the lobby at the given index.\n\nReturns `Int64`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name  | type  | description                                      |\n| ----- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| index | Int32 | the index at which to access the list of lobbies |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManger.Search(search, () =>\n{\n  var count = lobbyManager.LobbyCount();\n  for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)\n  {\n    var id = lobbyManager.GetLobbyId(i);\n    Console.WriteLine("Found lobby {0}", id);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## ConnectVoice\n\nConnects to the voice channel of the current lobby. When connected to voice, the user can open their Discord overlay to see a list of other users with whom they are in voice, allowing them to mute/deafen themselves as well as mute/adjust the volume of other lobby members.\n\nYou can also allow users to adjust voice settings for your game with [Overlay OpenVoiceSettings](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_OVERLAY/openvoicesettings).\n\nWhen integrating lobby voice into your game, be thoughtful about the user\'s experience. Auto-joining to voice can be jarring for users who may not be expecting it. We recommend voice always being opt-in, or at least that you provide an option for a player to choose whether or not to auto-join the voice channel of lobbies they join.\n\nReturns `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description               |\n| ------- | ----- | ------------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby to voice connect to |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.ConnectVoice(290926798626357250, (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Voice connected!");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## DisconnectVoice\n\nDisconnects from the voice channel of a given lobby.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description                    |\n| ------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby to voice disconnect from |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.DisconnectVoiceLobby(290926798626357250, (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Voice disconnected!");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## OnLobbyUpdate\n\nFires when a lobby is updated.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description        |\n| ------- | ----- | ------------------ |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby that updated |\n\n## OnLobbyDelete\n\nFired when a lobby is deleted.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type   | description                                    |\n| ------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64  | lobby that was deleted                         |\n| reason  | string | reason for deletion - this is a system message |\n\n## OnMemberConnect\n\nFires when a new member joins the lobby.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description           |\n| ------- | ----- | --------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby the user joined |\n| userId  | Int64 | user that joined      |\n\n## OnMemberUpdate\n\nFires when data for a lobby member is updated.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description                   |\n| ------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby the user is a member of |\n| userId  | Int64 | user that was updated         |\n\n## OnMemberDisconnect\n\nFires when a member leaves the lobby.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description                    |\n| ------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby the user was a member of |\n| userId  | Int64 | user that left                 |\n\n## OnMessage\n\nFires when a message is sent to the lobby.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type   | description                  |\n| ------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64  | lobby the message is sent to |\n| userId  | Int64  | user that sent the message   |\n| data    | byte[] | the message contents         |\n\n## OnSpeaking\n\nFires when a user connected to voice starts or stops speaking.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name     | type  | description                                             |\n| -------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| lobbyId  | Int64 | lobby the user is connceted to                          |\n| userId   | Int64 | user in voice                                           |\n| speaking | bool  | `true` == started speaking, `false` == stopped speaking |\n\n## Connecting to Lobbies\n\nIn the preceding section, you probably noticed there are a couple different methods for connecting to a lobby: `Connect()` and `ConnectWithActivitySecret()`. Lobbies in Discord are even more useful when hooked together with Activities/Rich Presence functionality; they give you everything you need to create an awesome game invite system.\n\nIf you are creating lobbies for users in the game client, and not on a backend server, consider using `GetLobbyActivitySecret` and `ConnectWithActivitySecret()`. `GetLobbyActivitySecret()` will return you a unique secret for the lobby concatenated with the lobby\'s id. You can pipe this value directly to the `Secrets.Join` field of the `Activity` payload. Then, when a user receives the secret, their client can call `ConnectWithActivitySecret()` with just the secret; the lobby id is parsed out automatically. This saves you the effort of concatenating the secret + id together yourself and then parsing them out again. As a code example:\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\nvar lobbyManager = discord.GetLobbyManager();\nvar activityManager = discord.GetActivityManager();\n\n// Create a lobby\nvar txn = lobbyManager.GetLobbyCreateTransaction();\ntxn.SetCapacity(5);\ntxn.SetType(Discord.LobbyType.Private);\n\nlobbyManager.CreateLobby(txn, (result, lobby) =>\n{\n  // Get the sepcial activity secret\n  var secret = lobbyManager.GetLobbyActivitySecret(lobby.id);\n\n  // Create a new activity\n  // Set the party id to the lobby id, so everyone in the lobby has the same value\n  // Set the join secret to the special activity secret\n  var activity = new Discord.Activity\n  {\n    Party =\n    {\n      Id = lobby.id,\n      Size = {\n        CurrentSize = 1,\n        MaxSize = 5\n      }\n    },\n    Secrets =\n    {\n      Join = secret\n    }\n  };\n\n  activityManager.UpdateActivity(activity, (result) =>\n  {\n    // Now, you can send chat invites, or others can ask to join\n    // When other clients receive the OnActivityJoin() event, they\'ll receive the special activity secret\n    // They can then directly call lobbyManager.ConnectLobbyWithActivitySecret() and be put into the lobby together\n  })\n});\n```\n\nIf you are creating lobbies with your own backend system (see the section below), this method may not be useful for you. In that case, you can use `Connect()` and pass the lobby id and secret as you normally would. If you\'re hooking up to Activities, just make sure you send both the lobby secret and the lobby id in the `Secrets.Join` field, so anyone who tries to join has the right data.\n\n### Example: Search for a Lobby, Connect, and Join Voice\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n\n// Search lobbies.\nvar query = lobbyManager.GetSearchQuery();\n\n// Filter by a metadata value.\nquery.Filter("metadata.ELO", Discord.LobbySearchComparison.EqualTo, Discord.LobbySearchCast.Number, "1337");\n\n// Only return 1 result max.\nquery.Limit(1);\n\nlobbyManager.Search(query, () =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("search returned {0} lobbies", lobbyManager.LobbyCount());\n\n  if (lobbyManager.LobbyCount() == 1)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("first lobby: {0}", lobbyManager.GetLobbyId(0));\n  }\n\n  // Get the id of the lobby, and connect to voice\n  var id = lobbyManager.GetLobbyId(0);\n  lobbyManager.ConnectVoice(id, (result) =>\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Connected to voice!");\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Example: Crossplayish\n\nSo, an explanation. Because the DLL that you ship with your game is a stub that calls out to the local Discord client for actual operations, the SDK does not necessarily care if the game was launched from Discord. As long as the player launching the game:\n\n1.  Has Discord installed\n2.  Has a Discord account\n3.  Has logged into Discord on their machine (whether or not Discord is open)\n\nThe SDK will function as if the game were launched from Discord and everything will work; if Discord is not currently launched, the SDK will launch it.\n\nThat means that if Player A is launching Your Amazing Game from Discord, and Player B is launching it from Other Cool But Not As Cool As Discord Game Store, as long as Player B meets the above criteria, both players can play with each other using Discord\'s lobbies + networking functions. If the SDK is not able to launch Discord for Player B—maybe they\'ve never installed/used Discord before!—you\'ll get an error saying as much. We\'re not saying what you _should_ do, but hey, wouldn\'t this make a really neat in-game touchpoint for your players to join their friends on Discord, and maybe even join your game\'s [verified server](https://discordapp.com/verification)?\n\nOK so this wasn\'t really a code example, but I think you get how this works.\n\n## The API Way\n\nBelow are the API endpoints and the parameters they accept. If you choose to interface directly with the Discord API, you will need a "Bot token". This is a special authorization token with which your application can access Discord\'s HTTP API. Head on over to [your app\'s dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/), and hit the big "Add a Bot User" button. From there, mutter _abra kadabra_ and reaveal the token. This token is used as an authorization header against our API like so:\n\n```\ncurl -x POST -h "Authorization: Bot <your token>" https://discordapp.com/api/some-route/that-does-a-thing\n```\n\n> Make sure to preprend your token with "Bot"!\n\nHere are the routes; they all expect JSON bodies. Also, hey, while you\'re here. You\'ve got a bot token. You\'re looking at our API. You should check out all the other [awesome stuff](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) you can do with it!\n\n### Create Lobby\n\n`POST https://discordapp.com/api/v6/lobbies`\n\nCreates a new lobby.

You can then send network messages to users by their user ID, easily retrieved via lobby methods.\n\nWe take care of all the route updating for you, so you can get up and running quickly and easily. If you\'d like to see how the lower level networking functionality works, or want to try it yourself so you can tweak it to your liking, check out [Networking](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_NETWORKING/);\n\n## ConnectNetwork\n\nConnects to the networking layer for the given lobby ID.

Talk to us at [dis.gd/devsupport](https://dis.gd/devsupport)\n\nA note before starting: this documentation covers the "low layer" networking level of the Discord GameSDK. What that means is that using the network manager directly affords you the flexbility to update routes, open channels, and handle events directly emitted by the SDK. If you\'re looking for something a bit easier and faster to integrate, we recommend that you check out the networking wrapper around our lobby documentation: [Integrated Networking](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_LOBBIES/integrated-networking)\n\nNeed a networking layer? Have a networking layer! This manager handles all things packets so you can get data from player to player and make your multiplayer...work. It:\n\n- Functions as a connection-oriented, TCP-like API, but over UDP!\n- Supports "reliable" and "unreliable" connections\n  - Packets with loot in them always get there, but player positioning can be eventually consistent\n- Features P2P-like connections, but routed through Discord\'s high-end server infrastructure\n  - All the benefits of direct connections, without the IP leaks!\n- Is encrypted!\n\nAn important note to make here is that our networking layer **is not peer-to-peer**. Discord has always promised that we will not leak your IP, and we promise to keep it that way. Though it seems like you are connected directly to another user, it routes through Discord\'s servers in the middle, ensuring both security and robust networking thanks to our servers.\n\n## GetPeerId\n\nGet the networking peer ID for the current user, allowing other users to send packets to them.\n\nReturns a `UInt64`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar myPeerId = networkManager.GetPeerId();\n```\n\n## Flush\n\nFlushes the network. Run this at the end of your game\'s loop, once you\'ve finished sending all you need to send. In Unity, for example, stick this in `LateUpdate()`.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nOnLateUpdate()\n{\n  networkManager.Flush();\n}\n```\n\n## OpenChannel\n\nOpens a channel to a user with their given peer ID on the given channel number.\n\nUnreliable channels—`reliable = false`—should be used for loss-tolerant data, like player positioning in the world. Reliable channels—`reliable = true`—should be used for data that _must_ get to the user, like loot drops!\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name      | type   | description                                          |\n| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| peerId    | UInt64 | the peerId of the user to connect to                 |\n| channelId | byte   | the channel on which to connect                      |\n| reliable  | bool   | whether the channel should be unreliable or reliable |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\nvar peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\nnetworkManager.OpenChannel(peerId, 0, false);\n```\n\n## OpenPeer\n\nOpens a network connection to another Discord user.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type   | description                                  |\n| ------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |\n| peerId | UInt64 | the peerId of the user to connect to         |\n| route  | string | the route the user is currently broadcasting |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\nvar peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\nvar route = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.route");\nnetworkManager.OpenPeer(peerId, route);\n```\n\n## UpdatePeer\n\nUpdates the network connection to another Discord user. You\'ll want to call this when notified that the route for a user to which you are connected has changed, most likely from a lobby member update event.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type   | description                |\n| ------ | ------ | -------------------------- |\n| peerId | UInt64 | the user\'s peerId          |\n| route  | string | the new route for the user |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.OnMemberUpdate += (lobbyId, userId) =>\n{\n  var peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\n  var newRoute = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.route");\n  networkManger.UpdatePeer(peerId, newRoute);\n}\n```\n\n## SendMessage\n\nSends data to a given peer ID through the given channel.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name      | type   | description                     |\n| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |\n| peerId    | UInt64 | the peer id to connect to       |\n| channelId | byte   | the channel on which to connect |\n| data      | byte[] | the data to send                |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\nvar peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\n\nbyte[] lootDrops = GameEngine.GetLootData();\nnetworkManager.SendMessage(peerId, 1, lootDrops);\n```\n\n## CloseChannel\n\nClose the connection to a given user by peerId on the given channel.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name      | type   | description                               |\n| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |\n| peerId    | UInt64 | the peerId of the user to disconnect from |\n| channelId | byte   | the route to close                        |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\nvar peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\nnetworkManager.CloseChannel(peerId, 0);\nConsole.WriteLine("Channel {0} to {1} closed", 0, peerId);\n```\n\n## ClosePeer\n\nDisconnects the network session to another Discord user.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type   | description       |\n| ------ | ------ | ----------------- |\n| peerId | UInt64 | the user\'s peerId |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\nvar peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\nnetworkManager.ClosePeer(peerId);\nConsole.WriteLine("Connection to {0} closed", peerId);\n```\n\n## OnMessage\n\nFires when you receive data from another user. This callback will only fire if you already have an open channel with the user sending you data. Make sure you\'re running `RunCallbacks()` in your game loop, or you\'ll never get data!\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name      | type   | description                |\n| --------- | ------ | -------------------------- |\n| peerId    | UInt64 | the peer id of the sender  |\n| channelId | byte   | the channel it was sent on |\n| data      | byte[] | the data sent              |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nnetworkManager.OnMessage += (peerId, channel, data) =>\n{\n  var stringData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(data);\n  Console.WriteLine("Message from {0}: {1}", peerId, stringData)\n}\n```\n\n## OnRouteUpdate\n\nFires when your networking route has changed. You should broadcast to other users to whom you are connected that this has changed, probably by updating your lobby member metadata for others to receive.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name  | type   | description               |\n| ----- | ------ | ------------------------- |\n| route | string | the new route to the user |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nnetworkManager.OnRouteUpdate += route =>\n{\n  var me = userManager.GetCurrentUser();\n  var lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\n  var txn = lobbyManager.GetMemberUpdateTransaction(lobbyId, me.Id);\n  txn.SetMetadata("route", route);\n  lobbyManager.UpdateMember(lobbyId, me.Id, txn, (result) =>\n  {\n    // Who needs error handling anyway\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Flush vs RunCallbacks\n\nA quick note here may be helpful for the two functions that should be called continuously in your game loop: `discord.RunCallbacks()` and `networkManager.Flush()`. `RunCallbacks()` pumps the SDK\'s event loop, sending any newly-received data down the SDK tubes to your game. For this reason, you should call it at the beginning of your game loop; that way, any new data is handled immediately by callbacks you\'ve registered. In Unity, for example, this goes in `Update()`.\n\n`Flush()` is specific to the network manager. It actually _writes_ the packets out to the stream. You should call this at the _end_ of your game loop as a way of saying "OK, I\'m done with networking stuff, go send all the stuff to people who need it". In Unity, for example, this goes in `LateUpdate()`.\n\n## Connecting to Each Other\n\nThis manager is built around the concept of routes between players, and then channels on those routes. Player A opens a route to Player B. This route will change, most commonly if the user\'s external IP address changes. As that route changes, the player will receive `OnRouteUpdate` events. They should then alert other lobby members that their route has changed by updating their lobbymetadata. Other lobby members will see those updates from the `OnLobbyMemberUpdate` event, and can call `UpdateRoute()` accordingly. A user\'s route could change frequently, so architect your system anticipating frequent route changes and updates.\n\nOnce Player A has a route open to Player B, Player A then opens a channel to Player B, and Player B does the same to Player A. Channels are the pipes down which data is actually sent. These two users can now send data back and forth to each other with `SendMessage()` and receive it with `OnMessage`.\n\nIn order to properly send and receive data between A and B, both users need to have **the same type of channel** open to each other **on the same channel number**. If A has Reliable Channel 4 open to B, B also needs Reliable Channel 4 open to A.\n\n## Example: Connecting to Another Player in a Lobby\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n\n// Join a lobby with another user in it\n// Get their peer id, and connect to them\n\nvar networkManager = discord.GetNetworkManager();\nvar lobbyManager = discord.GetLobbyManager();\nvar userManager = discord.GetUserManager();\n\nvar me;\nvar otherUserPeerId;\nvar lobbyId;\n\n// Get yourself\nme = userManager.GetCurrentUser();\n\n// This will fire once you connect to the lobby\n// Telling you which route is yours\nnetworkManager.OnRouteUpdate += route =>\n{\n  var txn = lobbyManager.GetMemberUpdateTransaction();\n  txn.SetMetadata("route", route);\n  lobbyManager.UpdateMember(lobbyId, me.Id, txn, (result =>\n  {\n    // Who needs error handling anyway\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\n  }))\n}\n\n// When other users get new routes, they\'ll update their metadata\n// Fetch it and update their route\nlobbyManager.OnMemberUpdate += (lobbyId, userId) =>\n{\n  var peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "peer_id");\n  var newRoute = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "route");\n  lobbyManger.UpdatePeer(peerId, newRoute);\n}\n\n// Connect to lobby with an id of 12345 and a secret of "password"\nlobbyManager.ConnectLobby(12345, "password", (Discord.Result x, ref Discord.Lobby lobby) =>\n{\n  lobbyId = lobby.Id;\n\n  // Add our own peer id to our lobby member metadata\n  // So other users can get it to connect to us\n  var txn = lobbyManager.CreateMemberUpdateTransaction();\n  txn.SetMetadata("peer_id", networkManager.GetPeerId());\n  lobbyManager.UpdateMember(lobby.Id, me.Id, txn, (result) =>\n  {\n    // Who needs error handling anyway\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\n  });\n\n  // Get the first member in the lobby, assuming someone is already there\n  var member = lobbyManager.GetMemberUserId(lobby.Id, 0);\n\n  // Get their peer id and route from their metadata, added previously\n  otherUserPeerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobby.Id, member.Id, "peer_id");\n  var otherRoute = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobby.Id, member.Id, "route");\n\n  // Connect to them\n  lobbyManager.OpenRoute(otherUserPeerId, otherRoute);\n\n}\n\n// Open an unreliable channel to the user on channel 0\n// And a reliable one on channel 1\nnetworkManager.OpenChannel(otherUserPeerId, 0, false);\nnetworkManager.OpenChannel(otherUserPeerId, 1, true);\n\n// An important data packet from our game engine\nbyte[] data = GameEngine.GetImportantData();\n\nif (isDataAboutPlayerLootDrops(data))\n{\n  // This is important and has to get there\n  // Send over reliable channel\n  networkManager.SendMessage(otherUserPeerId, 1, data);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // This is eventually consistent data, like the player\'s position in the world\n    // It can be sent over the unreliable channel\n    networkManager.SendMessage(otherUserPeerId, 0, data);\n}\n\n// Done; ship it!\nnetworkManager.Flush();\n```\n'},1981:function(e,n){e.exports='# Overlay\n\n> info\n> Need help with the SDK? Talk to us at [dis.gd/devsupport](https://dis.gd/devsupport)\n\nDiscord comes with an awesome built-in overlay, and you may want to make use of it for your game. This manager will help you do just that! It:\n\n- Gives you the current state of the overlay for the user\n  - Locked, enabled, unlocked, open, closed, etc.\n- Allows you to change that state\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### ActivityActionType Enum\n\n| value    |\n| -------- |\n| Join     |\n| Spectate |\n\n## IsEnabled\n\nCheck whether the user has the overlay enabled or disabled. You probably want to make this check before attempting to interact with the overlay.\n\nReturns a `bool`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nif (!overlaymanager.IsEnabled())\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("Could not complete operation. Please enable the overlay and relaunch the game.");\n}\n\nelse {\n  DoTheThing();\n}\n```\n\n## IsLocked\n\nCheck if the overlay is currently locked or unlocked\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nif (overlayManager.IsLocked())\n{\n  overlayManager.SetLocked(false);\n}\n```\n\n## SetLocked\n\nLocks or unlocks the overlay. Calling `SetLocked(true);` will also close any modals in the overlay or in-app from things like IAP purchase flows.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type | description                |\n| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- |\n| locked | bool | lock or unlock the overlay |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nif (overlayManager.IsLocked())\n{\n  overlayManager.SetLocked(false);\n}\n```\n\n## OpenActivityInvite\n\nOpens the overlay modal for sending game invitations to users, channels, and servers. In order for this to function, you must have the proper activity fields set on the local client before attempting to use this feature. To know what you need for Spectate and Join invites, refer to [Activity Action Field Requirements](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/activity-action-field-requirements).\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name | type               | description                 |\n| ---- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |\n| type | ActivityActionType | what type of invite to send |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\noverlayManager.OpenActivityInvite(Discord.ActivityActionType.Join, (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.OK)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("User is now inviting others to play!");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## OpenGuildInvite\n\nOpens the overlay modal for joining a Discord guild, given its invite code. An invite code for a server may look something like `fortnite` for a verified server—the full invite being `discord.gg/fortnite`—or something like `rjEeUJq` for a non-verified server, the full invite being `discord.gg/rjEeUJq`.\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` via callback. Note that a successful `Discord.Result` response does not necessarily mean that the user has joined the guild. If you want more granular control over and knowledge about users joining your guild, you may want to look into implementing the [`guilds.join` OAuth2 scope in an authorization code grant](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant) in conjunction with the [Add Guild Members](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/add-guild-member) endpoint.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name | type   | description                |\n| ---- | ------ | -------------------------- |\n| code | string | an invite code for a guild |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\noverlayManager.OpenGuildInvite("rjEeUJq", (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Invite was valid and overlay is open");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## OpenVoiceSettings\n\nOpens the overlay widget for voice settings for the currently connected application. These settings are unique to each user within the context of your application. That means that a user can have different favorite voice settings for each of their games!\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167844/48321255-f4a44080-e5d5-11e8-930c-044a1b76d76f.png)\n\nAlso, when connected to a lobby\'s voice channel, the overlay will show a widget that allows users to locally mute, deafen, and adjust the volume of others.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167844/48321253-f2da7d00-e5d5-11e8-94f5-c6a5314b8a07.png)\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\noverlayManager.OpenVoiceSettings((result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Overlay is open to the voice settings for your application/")\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## OnToggle\n\nFires when the overlay is locked or unlocked (a.k.a. opened or closed)\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type | description                           |\n| ------ | ---- | ------------------------------------- |\n| locked | bool | is the overlay now locked or unlocked |\n\n## Example: Unlock the Overlay\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n\nvar overlayManager = discord.GetOverlayManager();\n\noverlayManager.OnLocked += locked =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("Overlay Locked: {0}", locked);\n};\noverlayManager.SetLocked(false);\n```\n\n## Example: Activate Overlay Invite Modal\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\nvar overlayManager = discord.GetOverlayManager();\n\n// Invite users to join your game\noverlayManager.OpenActivityInvite(ActivityActionType.Join, (result) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("Overlay is now open!");\n})\n```\n\nAnd that invite modal looks like this!\n\n![](overlay-invite.gif)\n'},1982:function(e,n){e.exports='# Relationships\n\n> info\n> Need help with the SDK? Talk to us at [dis.gd/devsupport](https://dis.gd/devsupport)\n\nThis manager helps you access the relationships your players have made on Discord. Unfortunately, it won\'t help them make relationships IRL. They\'re on their own for that. It lets you:\n\n- Access a user\'s relationships\n- Filter those relationships based on a given criteria\n- Build a user\'s friends list\n\n## First Notes\n\nRelationships on Discord change often; people start and stop playing games, go online, offline, invisible, or otherwise change state. Therefore, there are some important factors to remember when working with this manager. When you are first getting a list of a user\'s relationships, before you can `Filter()`, you need to wait for the `OnRefresh` callback to fire. This is your indicator that Discord has successfully taken a snapshot of the state of all your relationships at a given moment. Now that you have this snapshot, you can `Filter()` it to build the list that you want, and then interate over that list to do whatever your game needs to do. Use this to build your initial social graph for a user.\n\nAs relationships change, the `OnRelationshipUpdate` event will fire. You can use this to update the user\'s social graph, changing the status of the other Discord users that you chose to filter, e.g. someone is now online, or now playing the game, or no longer playing.\n\nAn example of how to do this properly is at the end of this documentation page.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### Relationship Struct\n\n| name     | type             | description                      |\n| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Type     | RelationshipType | what kind of relationship it is  |\n| User     | User             | the user the relationship is for |\n| Presence | Presence         | that user\'s current presence     |\n\n###### RelationshipType Enum\n\n| value           | description                                                                      |\n| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| None            | user has no intrinsic relationship                                               |\n| Friend          | user is a friend                                                                 |\n| Blocked         | user is blocked                                                                  |\n| PendingIncoming | user has a pending incoming friend request to connected user                     |\n| PendingOutgoing | current user has a pending outgoing friend request to user                       |\n| Implicit        | user is not friends, but interacts with current user often (frequency + recency) |\n\n###### Presence Struct\n\n| name     | type     | description                      |\n| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Status   | Status   | the user\'s current online status |\n| Activity | Activity | the user\'s current activity      |\n\n###### Status Enum\n\n| name         | value |\n| ------------ | ----- |\n| Offline      | 0     |\n| Online       | 1     |\n| Idle         | 2     |\n| DoNotDisturb | 4     |\n\n## Filter\n\nFilters a user\'s relationship list by a boolean condition.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nA function that takes a `Relationship` parameter.\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nrelationshipsManager.Filter(relationship =>\n{\n  return relationship.Presence.Status == Discord.Status.Online;\n});\n```\n\n## Get\n\nGet the relationship between the current user and a given user by id.\n\nReturns a `Relationship`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type  | description                 |\n| ------ | ----- | --------------------------- |\n| userId | Int64 | the id of the user to fetch |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar friend = relationshipsManager.Get(53908232506183680);\nConsole.WriteLine("This is my friend, {0}", friend.User.Username);\n```\n\n## GetAt\n\nGet the relationship at a given index when iterating over a list of relationships.\n\nReturns a `Relationship`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name  | type   | description       |\n| ----- | ------ | ----------------- |\n| index | UInt32 | index in the list |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nfor (int i = 0; i < relationshipsManager.Count(); i++)\n{\n  var r = relationshipsManager.GetAt(i);\n  Console.WriteLine("This person is {0}", r.User.Username);\n}\n```\n\n## Count\n\nGet the number of relationships that match your `Filter()`.\n\nReturns an `Int32`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nfor (int i = 0; i < relationshipsManager.Count(); i++)\n{\n  var r = relationshipsManager.At(i);\n  Console.WriteLine("This person is {0}", r.User.Username);\n}\n```\n\n## OnRefresh\n\nFires at initialization when Discord has cached a snapshot of the current status of all your relationships.

We're glad you made it. This SDK is here to solve all your problems, if your problems include finding an awesome SDK to help develop your game. Our SDK is like Clippy, if Clippy were built on a modern tech stack, talked less, and was an awesome game development SDK.\n\n## Step 0 - Some Notes\n\nBefore we get off to the races, a couple notes on the SDK:\n\n- All strings in the SDK are UTF8 strings\n  - Make sure you've converted properly if necessary!\n- The SDK is **_NOT_** threadsafe!\n  - Being callback-based, we thought that'd be confusing and inconsistent\n\nAnd now you know, and knowing is half the battle.\n\n## Step 1 - Get the Thing\n\nI know you're already convinced, so let's begin. First, get the SDK. Here it is:\n\n- [Discord Game SDK](https://dl-game-sdk.discordapp.net/latest/discord_game_sdk.zip)\n\nThere's a few things in there, but let's quickly talk about what the SDK actually _is_. Inside the `lib/` folder, you'll see `x86/` and `x86_64/` that have some `.lib`, `.bundle`, and `.dll` files. You'll also notice that those files are _really_ small, just a couple hundred kilobytes. What these are are stubs for the Discord SDK. These are the things you want to distribute with your game. When you initialize the SDK, these stubs will call back to the locally installed Discord app to actually do the things your game needs. That means that the SDK will launch Discord if it's not already launched, or give you an error if Discord is not installed.\n\nWe designed the SDK this way with two things in mind. First, it allows you as a developer to distribute the Discord SDK on other platforms. As long as the player has Discord running, the SDK will work no matter where the game is launched from. Secondly, it lets you get the latest updates without having to actually download and ship a new SDK version—all the updates will happen in the actual Discord client!\n\n## Get Set Up\n\nNext, we need to set up the application for your game. An application is the base \"entity\" in Discord for your game; it's what all the builds, branches, SKUs, store pages, assets, etc. will be filed under.\n\nHead over to our [developer site](https://discordapp.com/developers/) and create an account/log in if you haven't yet. The first thing we're going to do is create a Team. Teams are groups of developers working together on applications; you should create a team for your organization at [https://discordapp.com/developers/teams](https://discordapp.com/developers/teams). You can invite other users to join your team and work on applications together with you.\n\nNow that your team is created, you'll want to make an application. To do so, click on \"Applications\" at the top of the page and create an application. Make sure you pick your newly-created team in the `Team` dropdown. You want your team to own the application; this unlocks store functionality! Now that your app is made, let's dive into some more setup.\n\nFirst, we'll need to set an OAuth2 redirect URL. You can add `http://127.0.0.1` in there for now; this powers some behind-the-scenes stuff you don't need to worry about.\n\nNext, enable Rich Presence for your application (it's a big button near the bottom of the page). This gives you access to a whitelist of users that you can set and invite to test your SDK. When you're ready to test with users **that are not the direct owner of the application**, you'll need to add them to this list.\n\nFinally, copy the **Client ID** at the top of the page. This id, also referred to as an \"application id\", is your game's unique identifier across Discord. Keep it handy!\n\nNow we're gonna start coding. Didn't think we'd get there so fast, did ya? _Think again!_ The next sections are code primers for the main languages of the SDK: C#, C, and C++. They'll get you up and running with the most basic examples, and then you're off to the races.\n\n## Code Primer - Unity (Csharp)\n\n- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.\n- Copy the contents of the `lib/` folder to `Assets/Plugins` in your Unity project\n- Copy the contents of the `csharp/` folder to `Assets/Plugins/DiscordGameSDK`\n- It's dangerous to go alone—take this small code block with you (to start)!\n\n```cs\n// Grab that Client ID from earlier\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(CLIENT_ID, (UInt64)Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n```\n\n- Make sure to call `discord.RunCallbacks()` in your main game loop; for Unity, that's your `Update()` function.\n\nDuring development, Discord will focus itself to ask for permission when you initialize the SDK. This will happen once a week (the duration of our OAuth2 tokens) for now, but will not happen at all in production.\n\nYou're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/Program.cs` in the SDK zip file.\n\n## Code Primer - Unreal Engine (C)\n\nBefore jumping into the C binding, a word of caution. If you are using Unreal Engine 3, or need to support an older version of Visual Studio, you may at first see some unexpected crashes due to compile configurations. The way to fix this is to wrap the include statement for the Discord GameSDK header file like so:\n\n```c\n#pragma pack(push, 8)\n#include \"discord_game_sdk.h\"\n#pragma pack(pop)\n```\n\nThis should let you use the SDK without any further crashes. Now, on with the show!\n\n- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.\n- Copy the contents of the `lib/` folder to the best location within your project for DLLs.\n- Copy the contents of the `c/` folder to your source directory\n- It's dangerous to go alone—take this small code block with you (to start)!\n\n```c\nstruct Application {\n    struct IDiscordCore* core;\n    struct IDiscordUsers* users;\n};\n\nstruct Application app;\n// Don't forget to memset or otherwise initialize your classes!\nmemset(&app, 0, sizeof(app));\n\nstruct IDiscordCoreEvents events;\nmemset(&events, 0, sizeof(events));\n\nstruct DiscordCreateParams params;\nparams.client_id = CLIENT_ID;\nparams.flags = DiscordCreateFlags_Default;\nparams.events = &events;\nparams.event_data = &app;\n\nDiscordCreate(DISCORD_VERSION, &params, &app.core);\n```\n\n- Make sure to call `core->run_callbacks(core, 0)` in your game loop.\n\nDuring development, Discord will focus itself to ask for permission when you initialize the SDK. This will happen once a week (the duration of our OAuth2 tokens) for now, but will not happen at all in production.\n\nYou're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/c/main.c` in the SDK zip file.\n\n## Code Primer - Unreal Engine 4 (Cpp)\n\n- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.\n- Copy the contents of the `lib/` folder to the best location within your project for DLLs.\n- Copy the contents of the `cpp/` folder to your source directory\n- It's dangerous to go alone—take this small code block with you (to start)!\n\n```cpp\n// Don't forget to memset or otherwise initialize your classes!\ndiscord::Core* core{};\nauto result = discord::Core::Create(CLIENT_ID, DiscordCreateFlags_Default, &core);\n```\n\n- Make sure to call `core->RunCallbacks()` in your game loop\n\nDuring development, Discord will focus itself to ask for permission when you initialize the SDK. This will happen once a week (the duration of our OAuth2 tokens) for now, but will not happen at all in production.\n\nYou're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/cpp/main.cpp` in the SDK zip file.\n\n## Testing Locally with Two Clients\n\n> info\n> Value from environment variable `DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID`\n\nWhile integrating the Discord GameSDK, you will probably find yourself wanting to test functionality between two game clients locally, be it for networking, Rich Presence, etc.\n\nWe also know that getting a test build of a game on two separate machines can be both difficult and cumbersome. So, we've got a solution for you! By using system environment variables, you can tell the SDK in a certain game client to connect to a specific Discord client. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Download Discord Canary. This is our most updated build, and is good to develop against: [Windows](https://discordapp.com/api/download/canary?platform=win) - [Mac](https://discordapp.com/api/download/canary?platform=osx)\n2. Download a second Discord Build. Here's our Public Test Build: [Windows](https://discordapp.com/api/download/ptb?platform=win) - [Mac](https://discordapp.com/api/download/ptb?platform=osx)\n3. Open up two Discord clients. We recommend you develop against Discord Canary, so you can use PTB or Stable for your test account\n4. Log in with two separate users. Make sure any test account is added to the application's App Whitelist in the portal!\n\nNow, in your game code, you can tell the SDK which client to connect to via the environment variable `DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID` **before initializing the SDK**. The value of the variable corresponds to the order in which you opened the clients, so `0` would connect to the first opened client, `1` the second, etc.\n\n###### Environment Variable Example\n\n```cs\n// This machine opened Discord Canary first, and Discord PTB second\n\n// This makes the SDK connect to Canary\nSystem.Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(\"DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID\", \"0\");\nvar discord = new Discord(applicationId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n\n// This makes the SDK connect to PTB\nSystem.Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(\"DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID\", \"1\");\nvar discord = new Discord(applicationId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n```\n\nThis will set the environment variable only within the context of the running process, so don't worry about messing up global stuff.\n\n> danger\n> If you test with this, make sure to remove this code before pushing a production build. It will interfere with the way that Discord launches games for users.\n\n## Section Checklist\n\nThink of these like those end of section review pages from your history textbooks, but we won't give you a pop quiz. I promise. By now, you should have the following:\n\n- The SDK downloaded\n- An application created, and a Client ID you're keeping handy\n- Rich Presence enabled on that application\n- An OAuth2 redirect URL added to that application\n- The proper libraries, DLLs, and header files in the right places for your game\n- A working SDK, via the small code snippets above\n\nIf you can check all those boxes, you are doing great! You're well-equipped to venture forth into the rest of the SDK and make full use of it's myriad of functionality. So, onwards, to game development!\n\n## Where...do I go...\n\nOh, yeah.

Talk to us at [dis.gd/devsupport](https://dis.gd/devsupport)\n\nWe\'ve been told that people playing games want to save their progress as they go, allowing them to come back where they left off and continue their epic journey of power.\n\nYeah, roguelikes. Even you.\n\nDiscord\'s storage manager lets you save data mapped to a key for easy reading, writing, and deleting both synchronously and asynchronously. It\'s saved to a super special directory, the Holy Grail of file mappings, that\'s unique per Discord user — no need to worry about your little brother overwriting your save file.\n\nCreating this manager will also spawn an IO thread for async reads and writes, so unless you really want to be blocking, you don\'t need to be!\n\n## Cloud Saves\n\nIf you want to take that save data on your players\' computers and save it to those **BIG COMPUTERS** in the cloud, look no further! All you need to do is head over to your manifest config file and set the following property:\n\n```js\n{\n  "storage": {\n    "sync": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYup, that\'s it! Don\'t know what this file is? Go read [Branches and Builds](#DOCS_DISPATCH_BRANCHES_AND_BUILDS/).\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### FileStat Struct\n\n| name         | type   | description                                  |\n| ------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Filename     | string | the name of the file                         |\n| Size         | UInt64 | the size of the file                         |\n| LastModified | UInt64 | timestamp of when the file was last modified |\n\n## GetPath\n\n> info\n> Value from environment variable `DISCORD_STORAGE_PATH`\n\nReturns the filepath to which Discord saves files if you were to use the SDK\'s storage manager. Discord has branch-specific, user-specific saves, so you and your little brother will never overwrite each others\' save files. If your game already has save file writing logic, you can use this method to get that user-specific path and help users protect their save files.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar savePath = storageManager.GetPath();\nConsole.WriteLine("You should write your save files to {0}", savePath);\n```\n\n## Read\n\nReads data synchronously from the game\'s allocated save file into a buffer.

Talk to us at [dis.gd/devsupport](https://dis.gd/devsupport)\n\nIf your game has DLC or offers in-app purchases, this manager is for you! The Store Manager allows you to fetch a users\' entitlements, as well as being notified when a user is granted an entitlement from a purchase flow for your game.\n\n## Application Test Mode\n\nWith this new Store Manager comes a new fun toggle in the Discord app itself: Application Test Mode! While in Application Test Mode, you can freely make "purchases" of SKUs tied to your application. That means you can test buying your game, buying DLC, or going through an IAP flow without any credit card charges.\n\n> info\n> You still need to have a valid payment method on file to "purchase" SKUs in Application Test Mode; it just won\'t be charged at checkout.\n\nTo enable it, first make sure you have a payment method on file in User Settings -> Billing. Then:\n\n1.  Open up the Discord app\n2.  Click on the settings cog in the bottom left corner\n3.  Go to Appearance -> allll the way at the bottom\n4.  Toggle "Developer Mode" **on** and "Application Test Mode" **on**, and enter your application ID\n5.  Exit user settings\n\nYou should now see an orange bar across the top of your screen; this means it worked! The dropdown in the orange bar will show you all the available SKUs for that application; you can select one of them to go to its store page. You can also view your Library and see all the branches of your game automagically there waiting for you!\n\nIf for some reason the "Install" button is greyed out, please check the following:\n\n1.  Do you have a `LIVE_BUILD_ID` on that branch for this SKU? Check with `dispatch branch list <application_id>`.\n2.  Do you have a price tier set for this SKU? If not, pick one!\n\nOnce those two conditions are met, you should be good to go! Entitlements "purchased" with this mode enabled can be revoked with the `DELETE /entitlements` HTTP endpoint, documented below.\n\n## Checking DLC Entitlements\n\nIf your game has DLC, and a user has purchased that DLC, you may want to check what they should have access to when the game launches. DLC entitlements will always be returned in a `FetchEntitlements()` call, so your game can check on each startup whether or not a user should have access to a certain new zone, raid, map, etc. based on their entitlements for DLC.\n\n## Checking Consumable Entitlements\n\nThe `Discord.SkuType.Consumable` type is used for entitlements that may be "consumed" by a game\'s own server infrastructure. That is to say that if you have in-app purchases like gem bundles, skins, etc., they will be a `Consumable` SKU type.\n\nWhat that means is that your game is expected to "consume" these entitlements by doing something on your game server—giving the player a level, more coins, a skin, etc.—and then telling Discord that\'s been done by calling the `POST /entitlements/<id>/consume`, documented below. Then, Discord will mark that entitlement as `consumed` (the `consumed` field in the returned object will be set to `true`).\n\nEntitlements to consumable SKUs are intended to signal your game\'s server/service/database that the user should get something in-game, and that the entitlement should be invalidated afterwards.\n\nThe same consumable SKU _can_ be purchased multiple times, but we have some safeguards in place to protect against possible abuse. If you purchase a consumable SKU, you cannot purchase a second one until the first one has been consumed; in the context of normal IAP transactions, your game will be auto-consuming entitlements as soon as they\'re created. If some malicious folks are somehow able to generate entitlements to your SKUs, they will not be able to consume them without your token, so you\'ll be safe!\n\nNon-consumable SKUs can only be purchased once.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### SKU Struct\n\n| name  | type     | description              |\n| ----- | -------- | ------------------------ |\n| Id    | Int64    | the unique ID of the SKU |\n| Type  | SkuType  | what sort of SKU it is   |\n| Name  | string   | the name of the SKU      |\n| Price | SkuPrice | the price of the SKU     |\n\n###### SkuType Enum\n\n| name        | value | description                                    |\n| ----------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| Application | 1     | SKU is a game                                  |\n| DLC         | 2     | SKU is a DLC                                   |\n| Consumable  | 3     | SKU is a consumable (in-app purchase)          |\n| Bundle      | 4     | SKU is a bundle (comprising the other 3 types) |\n\n###### SkuPrice Struct\n\n| name     | type   | description                       |\n| -------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |\n| Amount   | UInt32 | the amount of money the SKU costs |\n| Currency | string | the currency the amount is in     |\n\n###### Entitlement Struct\n\n| name  | type            | description                                     |\n| ----- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Id    | Int64           | the unique ID of the entitlement                |\n| Type  | EntitlementType | the kind of entitlement it is                   |\n| SkuId | Int64           | the ID of the SKU to which the user is entitled |\n\n###### EntitlementType Enum\n\n| name                | value | description                                                    |\n| ------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Purchase            | 1     | entitlement was purchased                                      |\n| PremiumSubscription | 2     | entitlement for a Discord Nitro subscription                   |\n| DeveloperGift       | 3     | entitlement was gifted by a developer                          |\n| TestModePurchase    | 4     | entitlement was purchased by a dev in application test mode    |\n| FreePurchase        | 5     | entitlement was granted when the SKU was free                  |\n| UserGift            | 6     | entitlement was gifted by another user                         |\n| PremiumPurchase     | 7     | entitlement was claimed by user for free as a Nitro Subscriber |\n\n## FetchSkus\n\nFetches the list of SKUs for the connected application, readying them for iteration.\n\nReturns `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nstoreManager.FetchSkus((result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Got skus!

They require a token for an authorization header. This token should be the "Bot token" of your application. To get this token, go to your application in the Dev Portal. In the left sidebar, click the `Bot` navigation item. You should then click the `Add Bot` button.\n\nAfter that, you can copy the token on this page and use it in your HTTP requests. The format for the authorization header should be `Authorization: Bot <token>`.\n\nNote that parameters with a `?` after the name denote optional fields.

You should call this endpoint from your backend server just before calling [StartPurchase](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORE/start-purchase) for the SKU you wish to discount. The user will then see a discounted price for that SKU at time of payment.

It\'s a subset of the robust settings from the overlay call for those of you that prefer to build UI and control things from your own game.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### InputModeType Enum\n\n| name          | value |\n| ------------- | ----- |\n| VoiceActivity | 0     |\n| PushToTalk    | 1     |\n\n###### InputMode Struct\n\n| name     | type          | description                                   |\n| -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| Type     | InputModeType | set either VAD or PTT as the voice input mode |\n| Shortcut | string        | the PTT hotkey for the user                   |\n\n###### Shortcut Keys\n\nKeys can be mapped as a combination by adding a "+" between values, such as `"shift + 4"` or `"ctrl + v"`.\n\n| key type      | value                                                     |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Alphabetical  | "a", "b", "c", etc.                                       |\n| Numerical     | "1", "2", "3", etc.                                       |\n| Symbols       | "-", "+", ".", "/", etc.                                  |\n| Function Keys | "f1", "f2", "f3", etc.                                    |\n| Gamepads      | standard XInput api values - "GAMEPAD0", "GAMEPAD1", etc. |\n| Enter         | "enter"                                                   |\n| Tab           | "tab"                                                     |\n| Spacebar      | "space"                                                   |\n| Backspace     | "backspace"                                               |\n| Escape        | "esc"                                                     |\n| Meta          | "meta"                                                    |\n| Shift         | "shift"                                                   |\n| Caps Lock     | "caps lock"                                               |\n| Alt           | "alt"                                                     |\n| Control       | "ctrl"                                                    |\n| Right Shift   | "right shift"                                             |\n| Right Alt     | "right alt"                                               |\n| Right Control | "right ctrl"                                              |\n| Right Meta    | "right meta"                                              |\n| Page Up       | "page up"                                                 |\n| Page Down     | "page down"                                               |\n| Scroll Lock   | "scroll lock"                                             |\n| Print Screen  | "print screen"                                            |\n| Rewind        | "rewind"                                                  |\n| Play          | "play"                                                    |\n| Fast Forward  | "fast forward"                                            |\n| Delete        | "del"                                                     |\n| End           | "end"                                                     |\n| Insert        | "insert"                                                  |\n| Break         | "break"                                                   |\n| Home          | "home"                                                    |\n| Up Arrow      | "up"                                                      |\n| Down Arrow    | "down"                                                    |\n| Left Arrow    | "left"                                                    |\n| Right Arrow   | "right"                                                   |\n\n## GetInputMode\n\nGet the current voice input mode for the user.\n\nReturns a `Discord.InputMode`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar voiceManager = discord.GetVoiceManager();\nvar inputMode = voiceManager.GetInputMode();\nConsole.WriteLine("The current input mode is {0}.

Returns a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object.\n\n## Modify Channel % PUT/PATCH /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}\n\nUpdate a channels settings. Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild. Returns a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) on success, and a 400 BAD REQUEST on invalid parameters. Fires a [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-update) Gateway event. If modifying a category, individual [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-update) events will fire for each child channel that also changes. For the **PATCH** method, all the JSON Params are optional.\n\n###### JSON Params\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Channel Type |\n|-------|------|-------------|--------------|\n| name | string | 2-100 character channel name | All |\n| position | integer | the position of the channel in the left-hand listing | All |\n| topic | string | 0-1024 character channel topic | Text |\n| nsfw | boolean | whether the channel is nsfw | Text |\n| rate\\_limit\\_per\\_user | integer | amount of seconds a user has to wait before sending another message (0-21600); bots, as well as users with the permission `manage_messages` or `manage_channel`, are unaffected | Text |\n| bitrate | integer | the bitrate (in bits) of the voice channel; 8000 to 96000 (128000 for VIP servers) | Voice |\n| user_limit | integer | the user limit of the voice channel; 0 refers to no limit, 1 to 99 refers to a user limit | Voice |\n| permission_overwrites | array of [overwrite](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/overwrite-object) objects | channel or category-specific permissions | All |\n| parent_id | snowflake | id of the new parent category for a channel | Text, Voice |\n\n## Delete/Close Channel % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}\n\nDelete a channel, or close a private message. Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild. Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their `parent_id` removed and a [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-update) Gateway event will fire for each of them. Returns a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object on success. Fires a [Channel Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-delete) Gateway event.\n\n>warn\n>Deleting a guild channel cannot be undone. Use this with caution, as it is impossible to undo this action when performed on a guild channel. In contrast, when used with a private message, it is possible to undo the action by opening a private message with the recipient again.\n\n## Get Channel Messages % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages\n\nReturns the messages for a channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission to be present on the current user. If the current user is missing the \'READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY\' permission in the channel then this will return no messages (since they cannot read the message history). Returns an array of [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) objects on success.\n\n>info\n>The before, after, and around keys are mutually exclusive, only one may be passed at a time.\n\n###### Query String Params\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Required | Default |\n|-------|------|-------------|----------|---------|\n| around | snowflake | get messages around this message ID | false | absent |\n| before | snowflake | get messages before this message ID | false | absent |\n| after | snowflake | get messages after this message ID | false | absent |\n| limit | integer | max number of messages to return (1-100) | false | 50 |\n\n## Get Channel Message % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}\n\nReturns a specific message in the channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the \'READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY\' permission to be present on the current user. Returns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object on success.\n\n## Create Message % POST /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages\n\n>warn\n>Before using this endpoint, you must connect to and identify with a [gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways) at least once.\n\nPost a message to a guild text or DM channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission to be present on the current user. If the `tts` field is set to `true`, the `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` permission is required for the message to be spoken. Returns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object. Fires a [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) Gateway event. See [message formatting](#DOCS_REFERENCE/message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.\n\nThe maximum request size when sending a message is 8MB.\n\nThis endpoint supports requests with `Content-Type`s of both `application/json` and `multipart/form-data`. You must however use `multipart/form-data` when uploading files. Note that when sending `multipart/form-data` requests the `embed` field cannot be used, however you can pass a JSON encoded body as form value for `payload_json`, where additional request parameters such as `embed` can be set.\n\n>info\n>Note that when sending `application/json` you must send at least one of `content` or `embed`, and when sending `multipart/form-data`, you must send at least one of `content`, `embed` or `file`.\n\n###### Params\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| content | string | the message contents (up to 2000 characters) |\n| nonce | snowflake | a nonce that can be used for optimistic message sending |\n| tts | boolean | true if this is a TTS message |\n| file | file contents | the contents of the file being sent |\n| embed | [embed](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/embed-object) object | embedded `rich` content |\n| payload_json | string | JSON encoded body of any additional request fields. |\n\n>info\n>For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.\n\n###### Example Request Body (application/json)\n\n```json\n{\n  "content": "Hello, World!",\n  "tts": false,\n  "embed": {\n    "title": "Hello, Embed!",\n    "description": "This is an embedded message."\n  }\n}\n```\n\n###### Example Request Bodies (multipart/form-data) \n\n| Field Name | Form Value |\n|------------|------------|\n| payload_json | `"content": "Hello, World!", "tts": false, "embed": { "title": "Hello, Embed!", "description": "This is an embedded message." }` |\n| file | file contents |\n\n| Field Name | Form Value |\n|------------|------------|\n| content | Hello, World! |\n| tts | false |\n| file | file contents |\n\n>warn\n>When sending `payload_json` in multipart requests, fields except for `file` are ignored.\n\n###### Using Attachments within Embeds\n\nYou can upload attachments when creating a message and use those attachments within your embed. To do this, you will want to upload files as part of your `multipart/form-data` body. Make sure that you\'re uploading files that contain a filename, as you will need a filename to reference against.\n\nIn the embed object, you can then set an image to use an attachment as its url with our attachment scheme syntax: `attachment://filename.png`\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t"embed": {\n\t\t"image": {\n\t\t\t"url": "attachment://screenshot.png"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n>warn\n>Only filenames with proper image extensions are supported for the time being.\n\n## Create Reaction % PUT /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions/{emoji#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object}/@me\n\nCreate a reaction for the message. `emoji` takes the form of `name:id` for custom guild emoji, or Unicode characters. This endpoint requires the \'READ\\_MESSAGE\\_HISTORY\' permission to be present on the current user.  Additionally, if nobody else has reacted to the message using this emoji, this endpoint requires the \'ADD\\_REACTIONS\' permission to be present on the current user. Returns a 204 empty response on success.\n\n## Delete Own Reaction % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions/{emoji#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object}/@me\n\nDelete a reaction the current user has made for the message.

This endpoint requires the \'MANAGE\\_MESSAGES\' permission to be present on the current user. Returns a 204 empty response on success.\n\n## Get Reactions % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions/{emoji#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object}\n\nGet a list of users that reacted with this emoji. Returns an array of [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) objects on success.\n\n###### Query String Params\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Required | Default |\n|-------|------|-------------|----------|---------|\n| before | snowflake | get users before this user ID | false | absent |\n| after | snowflake | get users after this user ID | false | absent |\n| limit | integer | max number of users to return (1-100) | false | 25 |\n\n## Delete All Reactions % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions\n\nDeletes all reactions on a message. This endpoint requires the \'MANAGE\\_MESSAGES\' permission to be present on the current user.\n\n## Edit Message % PATCH /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}\n\nEdit a previously sent message. You can only edit messages that have been sent by the current user. Returns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object. Fires a [Message Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-update) Gateway event.\n\n>info\n>All parameters to this endpoint are optional.\n\n###### JSON Params\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| content | string | the new message contents (up to 2000 characters) |\n| embed | [embed](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/embed-object) object | embedded `rich` content |\n\n## Delete Message % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}\n\nDelete a message. If operating on a guild channel and trying to delete a message that was not sent by the current user, this endpoint requires the `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission. Returns a 204 empty response on success. Fires a [Message Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-delete) Gateway event.\n\n## Bulk Delete Messages % POST /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/bulk-delete\n\nDelete multiple messages in a single request.

Users can spawn across the entire platform, be members of\nguilds, participate in text and voice chat, and much more. Users are separated by a distinction of "bot" vs "normal." Although they are similar, bot users are automated users that are "owned" by another user. Unlike normal users, bot users do\n_not_ have a limitation on the number of Guilds they can be a part of.\n\n## Avatar Data\n\nAvatar data is a [Data URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) that supports JPG, GIF, and PNG formats. An example Data URI format is:\n\n```\ndata:image/jpeg;base64,BASE64_ENCODED_JPEG_IMAGE_DATA\n```\n\nEnsure you use the proper header type (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`) that matches the image data being provided.\n\n## Usernames and Nicknames\n\nDiscord enforces the following restrictions for usernames and nicknames:\n\n1.  Names can contain most valid unicode characters. We limit some zero-width and non-rendering characters.\n2.  Names must be between 2 and 32 characters long.\n3.  Names are sanitized and trimmed of leading, trailing, and excessive internal whitespace.\n\nThe following restrictions are additionally enforced for usernames:\n\n1.  Names cannot contain the following substrings: \'@\', \'#\', \':\', \'\\```\'.\n2.  Names cannot be: \'discordtag\', \'everyone\', \'here\'.\n\nThere are other rules and restrictions not shared here for the sake of spam and abuse mitigation, but the majority of users won\'t encounter them. It\'s important to properly handle all error messages returned by Discord when editing or updating names.\n\n### User Object\n\n###### User Structure\n\n| Field         | Type      | Description                                                                                          | Required OAuth2 Scope |\n| ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |\n| id            | snowflake | the user\'s id                                                                                        | identify              |\n| username      | string    | the user\'s username, not unique across the platform                                                  | identify              |\n| discriminator | string    | the user\'s 4-digit discord-tag                                                                       | identify              |\n| avatar        | ?string   | the user\'s [avatar hash](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting)                                           | identify              |\n| bot?

This guide is intended to show some best practices on how to make that data the best it can be. It will include images and code samples; for full technical documentation, see our developer documentation.\n\nIf you take away one thing from this guide, let it be this:\n\n>warn\n>Rich Presence data should give others a clear understanding of what someone is doing so they can decide if they want to play together or not.\n\n## Who should use Rich Presence?\n\nRich Presence is a powerful way to integrate your game with Discord. To do it most effectively, you should think about its purpose and how well (or not) it matches with your game and your implementation. Rich Presence is designed for these three things:\n\n1. Show interesting, unique, actionable data in a user’s profile\n2. Allow friends to spectate each other’s games\n3. Join a friend’s in-game party or server directly from Discord\n\nWe certainly don’t want to stifle creativity, especially for games that can use Rich Presence in an interesting way. However, keep in mind that this sort of gameplay is what it was designed for, and how players will normally interact with it.\n\nIf you want to do something creative, wacky, funky, or otherwise out-there with Rich Presence for your players and aren’t sure if you can, feel free to drop us a line at [gamedevs@discordapp.com](mailto:gamedevs@discordapp.com). We’re always happy to help!\n\n## How should you think about the data you show?\n\nThe data in your players’ profiles is the first thing that others on Discord will see about your game, both those familiar with it and those who have never played. It should answer two questions: can I play with my friend right now, and if not, when can I? Show data like:\n\n- What the player is currently doing\n- How much time has elapsed or remains (if applicable)\n- Their party state\n- Your cool artwork!\n\nFor a great real world example, check out [Holodrive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370770/Holodrive/) for free on Steam!\n\n## Tips\n\n### Keep it Short\n\n- `details` and `state` should be snippets of data, not sentences.\n- Make sure your strings stay on one line—especially on the small profile!\n\n###### Examples\n\n| Bad | Good |\n|:-----:|:----: |\n| ![](rp-long-strings.png) | ![](rp-short-strings.png) |\n| The data wraps onto multiple lines. It’s repetitive, slower to read, and messy. | The data all fits on one line per string. Clean! |\n\n### Make it Actionable!\n\n- Always keep party size data up to date.\n- Keep accurate track of party state: In Queue, In Game, In Menus, etc.\n- Include game modes, ranked vs. unranked, etc. so others can clearly see.\n\n###### Examples\n\n| Bad | Good |\n|:-----:|:----: |\n| ![](rp-non-actionable.png) | ![](rp-actionable.png) |\n| While Rank 9999 is impressive, it doesn’t present any actionable data for their friends. | This player is in queue for something I want to play. Let's ask to join that open spot! |\n\n### Use ALL of the fields (where applicable)!\n\n- Make use of all the fields that are applicable to you.\n- Save space by putting map and character names in the tooltips.\n- Try not to repeat information.\n\n###### Examples\n\n| Bad | Good |\n|:-----:|:----: |\n| ![](rp-not-all-fields.png) | ![](rp-all-fields.png) |\n| The map name takes up space and makes the player's status harder to read at a glance. | Moving the name of the map to the tooltip makes the data cleaner and frees up space for the score. |\n\n### Have interesting, expressive art!\n\n- The large image should be consistent for all players in a party.\n- The small image is where you can customize on a per-player basis.\n- Use high resolution artwork so your art looks great on fancy, high DPI screens.\n- We strongly recommend image sizes of 1024x1024 pixels.\n\n###### Examples\n\n| Bad | Good |\n|:-----:|:----: |\n| ![](rp-bad-art.png) | ![](rp-good-art.png)|\n| The image is dark and unfocused. Highly-detailed images can be hard to see. | This image is bright and matches the details. Let's help! |\n"},1997:function(e,n){e.exports="# Rich Presence FAQ\n\nBelow are answers to some common questions about integrating Rich Presence with your game. If you don't see your question answered here, feel free to reach out to [gamedevs@discordapp.com](mailto:gamedevs@discordapp.com) for more help.\n\n#### Q: I see \"Playing MyGame\", but no Rich Presence data.\n\nThere's a couple things that could be going on:\n\n- If you're running two instances of the Discord client, check both!\n- Double check that your `Discord_Initialize()` function is correct.\n\nThroughout development, make sure you have your `errored()` and `disconnected()` callbacks hooked up for debugging. You can open up the console in Discord and look for errors pertaining to `SET_ACTIVITY` for more information as well.\n\n#### Q: I'm not seeing Spectate buttons on my profile.\n\nMake sure you applied for approval! If you want the Spectate button on your players' profiles, we require your integration to go through an approval process. If you have applied and have been approved and still don't see the buttons, check your Discord console for errors.\n\n#### Q: What happens if someone has more than one game running that supports Rich Presence?\n\nDue to recent changes in our infrastructure for support of multi-activities, the behavior of multiple connected Rich Presence apps has changed from what it was before. Previously, whichever application was focused would be the presence that was shown. With the recent changes, the application that connected _first_ is now displayed.\n\nHowever, invite functionality across multiple connected applications now works no matter which app is display on a user's profile. For example, if you are hosting a Spotify listening party, playing Game A that allows you to send Join invites, and playing Game B that allows you to send Spectate invites, you'll be able to send invites to all three simultaneously!\n\n#### Q: What if someone looking at my profile or an invite doesn't own the game?\n\nAnyone can see your profile data, whether they own the game or not. They'll only be able to interact with chat invites or profile buttons if they own the game and have launched it at least once. Otherwise, the invite/button tooltip will show \"Game Not Detected\".\n\n#### Q: Do join invitations allow players to select the number of open slots?\n\nCurrently, the SDK does not support this. Party slot information is determined by the party data you sent in your presence payload.\n\n#### Q: Can I send images via the payload rather than uploading them to my Developer Dashboard?\n\nUnfortunately, the SDK does not support this feature right now. However, we hear your desires! We know that a lot of games, like customization-heavy RPGs, would benefit greatly from being able to programmatically upload assets. It may be something we tackle in the future.\n\n#### Q: Can I change something in the SDK for my own purposes?\n\nGo nuts! The SDK is open source by design. If you need or want to change something for the purposes of your specific integration—like changing our JSON parser, or changing all of the variable names to the names of your pets—go ahead and tinker to your heart's content.\n\n#### Q: OK—I've got it working! Now, how do I make my integration look _awesome_?\n\nI'm happy ~~we preempted your question~~ you asked! Check out our [Rich Presence Best Practices](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_BEST_PRACTICES/) guide for a rundown on how to make your integration the best that it can be!\n"},1998:function(e,n){e.exports="# Getting Approved for Spectate\n\n> info\n> Ask to Join no longer requires whitelisting or approval. Everyone has access to it, and Ask to Join requests are now automatically handled within the Discord overlay. Enjoy!\n\nFor the majority of Rich Presence, we do not require any sort of approval or whitelisting. You are free to update presence data and create join and spectate chat invites without us looking it over. However, if you want to add the “Spectate” button on your players’ profiles, we want to take a look first and ensure that you get any support you might need.\n\nYou’ll need to have the following prepared for the approval process:\n\n- A video demonstrating your integration of the feature\n\nThese submissions should be in a polished, finalized state rather than works in progress.\n\n## Spectate Video\n\nIf your game supports spectating, you probably want to apply for our Spectate feature as well! This displays a button on your players’ profiles that allows their friends to easily spectate their game. Clicking the button will launch the game client into its specific spectate mode. Here’s an example!\n\n![](spectate.gif)\n\nTo be approved for Spectate, submit a video of your game’s Spectate flow that looks something like the above example. Specifically, we want to see:\n\n#### Player\n\n- Clicks Spectate on a friend’s profile\n- Game client launches\n- Begin spectating friend\n\nIn the case of spectating, your players should not be able to join the game directly. If you want players to be able to join a game session, use our Ask to Join feature instead. Discord’s Spectate feature is limited to a “true spectate” experience—that means no joining on.\n\nTo test Spectate for your game, you can add whitelisted users on [your app's developer dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) who will then have the feature enabled on their profile.\n"},1999:function(e,n){e.exports='# Introducing Rich Presence\n\n> danger\n> The SDK that this documentation references, [Discord-RPC](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc), has been deprecated in favor of our new [Discord GameSDK](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/). Replacement functionality for the Rich Presence SDK can be found in the [Activity Manager](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/) of that SDK. This documentation can be referenced for education but does not entirely reflect the new SDK.\n\nHow easy is it for people to play your game together? With Rich Presence from Discord, it just got so easy, a ~~caveman~~ Junior Dev could do it.\n\nIf you are testing a game integration with Rich Presence, other users will be able to see it. Please create a private test account and do not join any public servers while testing your integration.\n\n> info\n> If you want to stay up to date with the latest developer news from Discord and learn about new and exciting ways to work with us, sign up for our [developer newsletter](https://discordapp.com/dev-newsletter).\n\n## So, what is it?\n\nRich Presence allows you to leverage the totally overhauled "Now Playing" section in a Discord user\'s profile to help people play your game together. Rich game data—including duration, score, current boss or map, and so much more—lives inside Discord. You can spectate a friend\'s game directly from their profile popout, or party up via beautiful chat embeds with real-time information about open party slots and the party\'s in-game status. No more exchanging usernames and friend codes, or wondering if there\'s room for you to join. Rich Presence is a living invitation to play together, or to watch your friends kick butt.\n\n## Step 0: Get the SDK\n\n> warn\n> Please use our new Discord GameSDK. Read the documentation and get it [here](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/).\n\n## So, how does it work?\n\nWe worked hard to make using Discord\'s Rich Presence system as easy as possible. All you need is our header file—what you will interact with—and our library—where we did all the hard work for you—and you are ready to roll!\n\nIn the header file, you\'ll find six event-emitting callbacks:\n\n1.  `ready()`\n2.  `errored()`\n3.  `disconnected()`\n4.  `joinGame()`\n5.  `spectateGame()`\n6.  `joinRequest()`\n\nThese six callbacks make up the entirety of what you need to implement. Behind the scenes, we do all the heavy lifting for you.\n\nThe header file also contains the `Discord_RunCallbacks()` function. This invokes any pending callbacks from Discord on the calling thread (it\'s thread safe!).\n\n## Initialization\n\nThe first step in implementing Rich Presence is [creating an application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). Once you\'ve created your application, note and save your `Client ID`. You will need this to initialize the SDK; this value will be referred to throughout this documentation as both `client_id` and `application_id`. Next, scroll down to the bottom of your application\'s page and hit the button that says "Enable Rich Presence". This will allow you to upload assets to your dashboard for later use.\n\nTo begin, you\'ll register your callback functions to the six `DiscordEventHandlers` and then call `Discord_Initialize()` with your `APPLICATION_ID`. If your game is distributed via Steam, you should also pass your application\'s Steam ID so Discord can launch your game through Steam:\n\n###### SDK Initialization Example\n\n```c\nvoid InitDiscord()\n{\n    DiscordEventHandlers handlers;\n    memset(&handlers, 0, sizeof(handlers));\n    handlers.ready = handleDiscordReady;\n    handlers.errored = handleDiscordError;\n    handlers.disconnected = handleDiscordDisconnected;\n    handlers.joinGame = handleDiscordJoinGame;\n    handlers.spectateGame = handleDiscordSpectateGame;\n    handlers.joinRequest = handleDiscordJoinRequest;\n\n    // Discord_Initialize(const char* applicationId, DiscordEventHandlers* handlers, int autoRegister, const char* optionalSteamId)\n    Discord_Initialize("418562325121990661", &handlers, 1, "1234");\n}\n```\n\nA quick breakdown on the `Discord_Initialize()` function:\n\n- `applicationId`: your client_id/application_id\n- `handlers`: the callback functions you registered for each Discord event\n- `autoRegister`: whether or not to register an application protocol for your game on the player\'s computer—necessary to launch games from Discord\n- `optionalSteamId`: your game\'s Steam application id, if your game is distributed on Steam\n\nWhen you are ready to publish your integration, we recommend digging into the source code of the SDK and copying `discord_register.h`, `discord_register_win.cpp`, `discord_register_osx.m`, and `discord_register_linux.cpp` into your installation and update process. By registering your application protocols on installation and update, your players won\'t need to run the game before being able to interact with invites, Ask to Join, and spectating in Discord.\n\n## Shutting Down\n\nDon\'t leave so soon! But when you _do_ shut down your application, don\'t forget to call `Discord_Shutdown()`. This properly terminates the thread and allows your application to shut down cleanly.\n\nIf you don\'t want to register all your event handlers at initialization, you can do so dynamically with `Discord_UpdateHandlers()`; this will allow you to register a new set of event handlers. Be mindful that this will delete old handlers if they are not explicitly bound to your handlers struct when calling this function.\n\n## Updating Presence\n\n> warn\n> Deprecated in favor of [Discord GameSDK ActivityManager.UpdateActivity()](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/update-activity)\n\nThe core of Discord\'s Rich Presence SDK is the `Discord_UpdatePresence()` function. This is what sends your game data up to Discord to be seen and used by others. You should call `Discord_UpdatePresence()` any time something important in the presence payload changes.\n\n`Discord_UpdatePresence()` has a rate limit of one update per 15 seconds. Developers do not need to do anything to handle this rate limit. The SDK will queue up any presence updates sent in that window and send the newest one once the client is free to do so. If you are sending presence updates very frequently and wondering why you don\'t see your Discord presence changing, that\'s why!\n\n###### Update Presence Example\n\n```c\nvoid UpdatePresence()\n{\n    char buffer[256];\n    DiscordRichPresence discordPresence;\n    memset(&discordPresence, 0, sizeof(discordPresence));\n    discordPresence.state = "In a Group";\n    sprintf(buffer, "Ranked | Mode: %d", GameEngine.GetMode());\n    discordPresence.details = buffer;\n    discordPresence.endTimestamp = time(0) + 5 * 60;\n    discordPresence.largeImageKey = "canary-large";\n    discordPresence.smallImageKey = "ptb-small";\n    discordPresence.partyId = GameEngine.GetPartyId();\n    discordPresence.partySize = 1;\n    discordPresence.partyMax = 6;\n    discordPresence.matchSecret = "4b2fdce12f639de8bfa7e3591b71a0d679d7c93f";\n    discordPresence.spectateSecret = "e7eb30d2ee025ed05c71ea495f770b76454ee4e0";\n    discordPresence.instance = 1;\n    Discord_UpdatePresence(&discordPresence);\n}\n```\n\n###### Update Presence Payload\n\n```c\ntypedef struct DiscordRichPresence {\n    const char* state; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* details; /* max 128 bytes */\n    int64_t startTimestamp;\n    int64_t endTimestamp;\n    const char* largeImageKey; /* max 32 bytes */\n    const char* largeImageText; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* smallImageKey; /* max 32 bytes */\n    const char* smallImageText; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* partyId; /* max 128 bytes */\n    int partySize;\n    int partyMax;\n    const char* matchSecret; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* joinSecret; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* spectateSecret; /* max 128 bytes */\n    int8_t instance;\n} DiscordRichPresence;\n```\n\n###### Update Presence Payload Fields\n\n| parameter      | type     | description                                                                | example                                                    |\n| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| state          | char\\*   | the user\'s current party status                                            | "Looking to Play", "Playing Solo", "In a Group"            |\n| details        | char\\*   | what the player is currently doing                                         | "Competitive - Captain\'s Mode", "In Queue", "Unranked PvP" |\n| startTimestamp | int64_t  | epoch seconds for game start - including will show time as "elapsed"       | 1507665886                                                 |\n| endTimestamp   | int64_t  | epoch seconds for game end - including will show time as "remaining"       | 1507665886                                                 |\n| largeImageKey  | char\\*   | name of the uploaded image for the large profile artwork                   | "default"                                                  |\n| largeImageText | char\\*   | tooltip for the largeImageKey                                              | "Blade\'s Edge Arena", "Numbani", "Danger Zone"             |\n| smallImageKey  | char\\*   | name of the uploaded image for the small profile artwork                   | "rogue"                                                    |\n| smallImageText | char\\*   | tootltip for the smallImageKey                                             | "Rogue - Level 100"                                        |\n| partyId        | char\\*   | id of the player\'s party, lobby, or group                                  | "ae488379-351d-4a4f-ad32-2b9b01c91657"                     |\n| partySize      | int      | current size of the player\'s party, lobby, or group                        | 1                                                          |\n| partyMax       | int      | maximum size of the player\'s party, lobby, or group                        | 5                                                          |\n| matchSecret    | char\\*   | [deprecated Notify Me feature, may be re-used in future]                   | MmhuZToxMjMxMjM6cWl3amR3MWlqZA==                           |\n| spectateSecret | char\\*   | unique hashed string for Spectate button                                   | MTIzNDV8MTIzNDV8MTMyNDU0                                   |\n| joinSecret     | char\\*   | unique hashed string for chat invitations and Ask to Join                  | MTI4NzM0OjFpMmhuZToxMjMxMjM=                               |\n| instance       | int8_t   | [deprecated Notify Me feature, may be re-used in future]                   | 1                                                          |\n\n> info\n> Sending `endTimestamp` will **always** have the time displayed as "remaining" until the given time.

This invite is tied to the player\'s party information; if their `partyId` changes, the invite will expire. If their `partySize` and `partyMax` changes, the invite will add, remove, and fill up slots dynamically.\n\nOther Discord users can click "Join" on the invitation. Their game will then launch, and the `joinGame()` callback will fire in their client with the inviting player\'s `joinSecret`. The client should reverse hash or otherwise unencrypt this secret and match the players together.\n\n### Ask to Join\n\nWhen Player B clicks the Ask to Join button on Player A\'s profile, the `joinRequest()` callback fires for Player A, sending the following data:\n\n###### Ask to Join Payload\n\n```c\ntypedef struct DiscordJoinRequest {\n    char userId[32];\n    char username[344];\n    char discriminator[8]\n    char avatar[128];\n} DiscordJoinRequest;\n```\n\n###### Ask to Join Payload Fields\n\n| parameter     | type      | description                                                                                                                         |\n| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| userId        | char[24]  | the userId of the player asking to join                                                                                             |\n| username      | char[344] | the username of the player asking to join                                                                                           |\n| discriminator | char[8]   | the discriminator of the player asking to join                                                                                      |\n| avatar\\*      | char[128] | the avatar hash of the player asking to join—see [image formatting](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting) for how to retrieve the image |\n\n> warn\n> `avatar` can be an empty string if the user has not uploaded an avatar to Discord\n\nWhen it fires, your game should surface this data with a Yes or No choice for Player A to accept whether or not they wish to play with Player B. Then, call `Discord_Respond()` with Player B\'s `userId` and the appropriate response code:\n\n###### Ask to Join Response Codes\n\n| code                 | value |\n| -------------------- | ----- |\n| DISCORD_REPLY_NO     | 0     |\n| DISCORD_REPLY_YES    | 1     |\n| DISCORD_REPLY_IGNORE | 2     |\n\nThe Ask to Join request persists for 30 seconds after the request is received, regardless of whether you have called `Discord_RunCallbacks()` within that window. Therefore, keep these two points in mind:\n\n- Ensure you call `Discord_RunCallbacks()` as frequently as possible to ensure your game client is up to date with any data from Discord\n- If the player is in a state in which they cannot interact with an Ask to Join request—like in the middle of a match—you should not send a `joinSecret` in the presence payload\n\n## Spectating\n\n> warn\n> Deprecated in favor of [Discord GameSDK ActivityManager.OnActivitySpectate](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/on-activity-spectate)\n\nTo enable the Spectate button on your players\' profiles, you\'ll need to be approved by us. Submit your integration for approval on your [app\'s developer dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). While there, you can also whitelist individual accounts for testing. Those accounts will have the Spectate button enabled on their profiles. For an in-depth explanation of what we look for during approval, see [Getting Approved](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_GETTING_APPROVED/).\n\n#### Relevant Callbacks:\n\n`spectateGame()`\n\n#### Relevant Payload Data:\n\n`spectateSecret`\n\nWhen you send the relevant payload data in the `Discord_UpdatePresence()` call, your player will gain the ability to invite a Discord chat channel to spectate their game. This invite is tied to the `matchSecret` and will expire when it changes.\n\nOther Discord users can click "Spectate" on the invitation. Their game will launch, and the `spectateGame()` callback will fire in their client with the original player\'s `spectateSecret`. The client should reverse hash or otherwise unencrypt this secret and spectate that player\'s game.\n\n## Secrets\n\nSecurity is of the utmost importance to us here at Discord, and we know it is for you, too. That\'s why we want to make sure that you properly understand `matchSecret`, `joinSecret`, and `spectateSecret` so that your game data is safe and secure over the wire.\n\nTo keep security on the up and up, Discord requires that you properly hash/encode/encrypt/put-a-padlock-on-and-swallow-the-key-but-wait-then-how-would-you-open-it your secrets.\n\nSecrets are obfuscated data of your choosing. They could be match ids, player ids, lobby ids, etc. You should send us data that someone else\'s game client would need to join or spectate their friend. If you can\'t or don\'t want to support those actions, you don\'t need to send us secrets.\n\n## Rich Presence Field Requirements\n\nAll fields in the `DiscordRichPresence` object are entirely optional. Anything you choose to omit simply won\'t be displayed; the UI will dynamically adapt from the full Rich Presence object all the way down to the basic presence view. We highly encourage you to include as many fields as you can to make your game as attractive and interactive for other players as possible. However, if you choose to be a bit more selective, here\'s a handy table for what each piece of Rich Presence requires:\n\n###### Rich Presence Field Requirements\n\n|     Field      | Custom Artwork | Spectating | Joining | Ask to Join |\n| :------------: | :------------: | :--------: | :-----: | :---------: |\n|     state      |                |            |         |             |\n|    details     |                |            |         |             |\n| startTimestamp |                |            |         |             |\n|  endTimestamp  |                |            |         |             |\n| largeImageKey  |       x        |            |         |             |\n| smallImageKey  |       x        |            |         |             |\n| largeImageText |       x        |            |         |             |\n| smallImageText |       x        |            |         |             |\n|    partyId     |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n|   partySize    |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n|    partyMax    |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n|  matchSecret   |                |            |         |             |\n|   joinSecret   |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n| spectateSecret |                |     x      |         |             |\n|    instance    |                |            |         |             |  |\n\n## Your New Developer Dashboard\n\nIncluded with the launch of Rich Presence is an overhaul of Discord\'s Developer Dashboard. We want to make Rich Presence as easy as possible to use. Our first step is helping you ditch your CDN. You\'re welcome.\n\nOK, well, not entirely. But! Discord _will_ host any and all artwork that you need to have the very richest of presences. Upload an image, tag it with a key—preferrably one you can remember—and **bam**. It\'s ready for Rich Presence use. Head over to your [applications page](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top) to check it out!\n\n> warn\n> **Asset keys are automatically normalized to lowercase**. Be mindful of this when referring to them in your code.\n\n## A note on testing and Game Detection\n\nIf you don\'t see Rich Presence data in your profile while testing, make sure you don\'t have multiple instances of Discord running—if you do, your presence might be changing in one of those!\n\nIf you\'re testing on your own, we recommend [downloading two separate release channels](https://discordapp.com/download) of the Discord desktop client. You can log into the stable, public test, and canary builds with separate credentials, making testing easier for a single developer.\n\n## So, what now?\n\nGet to coding! We can\'t wait to see the awesome integration you come up with. If you need some quick questions answered, look no further than our [Rich Presence FAQ](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_FAQ/). If you want to know how to make your integration the best it can be, read our [Best Practices Guide](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_BEST_PRACTICES/).

Unfortunately, no, you can\'t show that a user\'s PUBG Chicken Dinner was all thanks to the amazing TotallyRealHardware RGB Mouse and Keyboard Set Extraordinaire™, but you _can_ give them an amazing experience using your hardware with Discord!\n\n## How\'s it work?\n\nI\'m glad you asked!\n\n1. [Create an application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) for your hardware vendor—save the Client ID!\n2. Talk to Discord via one simple HTTP or WebSocket call\n3. Send us a [`SET_CERTIFIED_DEVICES`](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/set-certified-devices) WebSocket payload or equivalent HTTP POST whenever the state of the device changes\n\nYup, that\'s it. You give us the real-time info about any connected devices, and we\'ll handle the rest to make sure that anyone using your device will have an awesome experience. Your device will also have a `CERTIFIED` badge in Discord\'s audio settings, and really, who doesn\'t love badges?\n\n![](certified-device.png)\n\n## Connecting\n\n###### Querystring Parameters\n\n| Name      | Value                | Required  |\n| --------- | -------------------- | --------- |\n| v         | `1`                  | All       |\n| client_id | your app\'s client id | All       |\n| encoding  | `json`               | WebSocket |\n\nYou can send event updates to the following URIs:\n\n###### HTTP\n\n```\nhttp://127.0.0.1:PORT/rpc?v=1&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID\n```\n\n###### WebSocket\n\n```\nws://127.0.0.1:PORT?v=1&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&encoding=json\n```\n\n`PORT` is a range of ports from `6463` to `6473`. You should iterate over these ports with your request until one returns a success response code or succeeds with a socket connection. Keep track of that port number for the rest of the session.\n\nTo keep your hardware in sync with Discord, send updates any time the hardware mute is toggled, or one of the voice features like echo cancellation is enabled or disabled by the user. This lets Discord get out of the way of your optimization when you\'re in control, or help out when you\'re not, ensuring an awesome experience for anyone using your hardware.\n\nEach time you update, send a full array of `devices`, sorted by your preffered priority. That means if you want a specific headset to be the default that Discord will attempt to use, put it first in the array.\n\n## Getting Device UUID\n\nFor each device in the `SET_CERTIFIED_DEVICES` payload, there is an `id` field. This `id` should be the Windows device\'s UUID, retrieved through the native Windows API.

Clients will receive events and data over the gateway they are connected to and send data over the REST API. The API for interacting with Gateways is complex and fairly unforgiving, therefore it\'s highly recommended you read _all_ of the following documentation before writing a custom implementation.\n\nThe Discord Gateway has a versioning system which is separate from the core APIs. The documentation herein is only for the latest version in the following table, unless otherwise specified.\n\n###### Gateway Versions\n\n| Version | Status       |\n| ------- | ------------ |\n| 6       | Available    |\n| 5       | Discontinued |\n| 4       | Discontinued |\n\n## Payloads\n\n###### Gateway Payload Structure\n\n| Field | Type                    | Description                                                                     | Present           |\n| ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| op    | integer                 | [opcode](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-opcodes) for the payload | Always            |\n| d     | ?mixed (any JSON value) | event data                                                                      | Always            |\n| s     | integer                 | sequence number, used for resuming sessions and heartbeats                      | Only for Opcode 0 |\n| t     | string                  | the event name for this payload                                                 | Only for Opcode 0 |\n\n### Sending Payloads\n\nPackets sent from the client to the Gateway API are encapsulated within a [gateway payload object](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sending-payloads-example-gateway-dispatch) and must have the proper opcode and data object set. The payload object can then be serialized in the format of choice (see [ETF/JSON](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/etfjson)), and sent over the websocket. Payloads to the gateway are limited to a maximum of 4096 bytes sent, going over this will cause a connection termination with error code 4002.\n\n###### Example Gateway Dispatch\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 0,\n  "d": {},\n  "s": 42,\n  "t": "GATEWAY_EVENT_NAME"\n}\n```\n\n### Receiving Payloads\n\nReceiving payloads with the Gateway API is slightly more complex than sending. When using the JSON encoding with compression enabled, the Gateway has the option of sending payloads as compressed JSON binaries using zlib, meaning your library _must_ detect (see [RFC1950 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#section-2.2)) and decompress these payloads before attempting to parse them. The gateway does not implement a shared compression context between messages sent.\n\n## Encoding and Compression\n\n#### ETF/JSON\n\nWhen initially creating and handshaking connections to the Gateway, a user can choose whether they wish to communicate over plain-text JSON or binary [ETF](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html). When using ETF, the client must not send compressed messages to the server. Note that Snowflake IDs are transmitted as 64-bit integers over ETF, but are transmitted as strings over JSON. See [erlpack](https://github.com/discordapp/erlpack) for an implementation example.\n\n#### Payload Compression\n\nWhen using JSON encoding with payload compression enabled (`compress: true` in identify), the Gateway may optionally send zlib-compressed payloads (see [RFC1950 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#section-2.2)). Your library _must_ detect and decompress these payloads to plain-text JSON before attempting to parse them. If you are using payload compression, the gateway does not implement a shared compression context between messages sent. Payload compression will be disabled if you use transport compression (see below).\n\n#### Transport Compression\n\nCurrently the only available transport compression option is `zlib-stream`. You will need to run all received packets through a shared zlib context, as seen in the example below. Every connection to the gateway should use its own unique zlib context.\n\n###### Transport Compression Example\n\n```python\n# Z_SYNC_FLUSH suffix\nZLIB_SUFFIX = b\'\\x00\\x00\\xff\\xff\'\n# initialize a buffer to store chunks\nbuffer = bytearray()\n# create a zlib inflation context to run chunks through\ninflator = zlib.decompressobj()\n\n# ...\ndef on_websocket_message(msg):\n  # always push the message data to your cache\n  buffer.extend(msg)\n\n  # check if the last four bytes are equal to ZLIB_SUFFIX\n  if len(msg) < 4 or msg[-4:] != ZLIB_SUFFIX:\n    return\n\n  # if the message *does* end with ZLIB_SUFFIX,\n  # get the full message by decompressing the buffers\n  msg = inflator.decompress(buffer).decode(\'utf-8\')\n  buffer = bytearray()\n\n  # here you can treat `msg` as either JSON or ETF encoded,\n  # depending on your `encoding` param\n```\n\n## Connecting to the Gateway\n\n### Connecting\n\n###### Gateway URL Params\n\n| Field     | Type    | Description                                   | Accepted Values                                                   |\n| --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| v         | integer | Gateway Version to use                        | 6 (see [Gateway versions](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-versions)) |\n| encoding  | string  | The encoding of recieved gateway packets      | \'json\' or \'etf\'                                                   |\n| compress? | string  | The (optional) compression of gateway packets | \'zlib-stream\'                                                     |\n\nThe first step in establishing connectivity to the gateway is requesting a valid websocket endpoint from the API. This can be done through either the [Get Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway) or the [Get Gateway Bot](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway-bot) endpoint.\n\nWith the resulting payload, you can now open a websocket connection to the "url" (or endpoint) specified. Generally, it is a good idea to explicitly pass the gateway version and encoding. For example, we may connect to `wss://gateway.discord.gg/?v=6&encoding=json`.\n\nOnce connected, the client should immediately receive an [Opcode 10 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/hello) payload, with information on the connection\'s heartbeat interval:\n\n###### Example Gateway Hello\n\n```json\n{\n  "heartbeat_interval": 45000,\n  "_trace": ["discord-gateway-prd-1-99"]\n}\n```\n\n### Heartbeating\n\nThe client should now begin sending [Opcode 1 Heartbeat](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/heartbeat) payloads every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds, until the connection is eventually closed or terminated. This OP code is also bidirectional. The gateway may request a heartbeat from you in some situations, and you should send a heartbeat back to the gateway as you normally would.\n\n> info\n> In the event of a service outage where you stay connected to the gateway, you should continue to heartbeat and receive ACKs. The gateway will eventually respond and issue a session once it\'s able to.\n\nClients can detect zombied or failed connections by listening for [Opcode 11 Heartbeat ACK](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/heartbeating-example-gateway-heartbeat-ack):\n\n###### Example Gateway Heartbeat ACK\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 11\n}\n```\n\nIf a client does not receive a heartbeat ack between its attempts at sending heartbeats, it should immediately terminate the connection with a non-1000 close code, reconnect, and attempt to resume.\n\n### Identifying\n\nNext, the client is expected to send an [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify):\n\n###### Example Gateway Identify\n\nThis is a minimal `IDENTIFY` payload. `IDENTIFY` supports additional optional fields for other session properties, such as payload compression, or an initial presence state. See [Example Identify](#DOCS_GATEWAY/identify-example-identify) for a more complete example.\n\n```json\n{\n  "token": "my_token",\n  "properties": {\n    "$os": "linux",\n    "$browser": "my_library",\n    "$device": "my_library"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the payload is valid, the gateway will respond with a [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) event. Your client is now considered in a "connected" state. Clients are limited to 1 identify every 5 seconds; if they exceed this limit, the gateway will respond with an [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session). It is important to note that although the ready event contains a large portion of the required initial state, some information (such as guilds and their members) is sent asynchronously (see [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) event).\n\n> warn\n> Clients are limited to 1000 `IDENTIFY` calls to the websocket in a 24-hour period. This limit is global and across all shards, but does not include `RESUME` calls. Upon hitting this limit, all active sessions for the bot will be terminated, the bot\'s token will be reset, and the owner will receive an email notification. It\'s up to the owner to update their application with the new token.\n\n## Resuming\n\nThe internet is a scary place. Disconnections happen, especially with persistent connections. Due to Discord\'s architecture, this is a semi-regular event and should be expected and handled. Discord has a process for "resuming" (or reconnecting) a connection that allows the client to replay any lost events from the last sequence number they received in the exact same way they would receive them normally.\n\nYour client should store the `session_id` from the [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready), and the sequence number of the last event it received. When your client detects that it has been disconnected, it should completely close the connection and open a new one (following the same strategy as [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/connecting)). Once the new connection has been opened, the client should send a [Gateway Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume):\n\n###### Example Gateway Resume\n\n```json\n{\n  "token": "my_token",\n  "session_id": "session_id_i_stored",\n  "seq": 1337\n}\n```\n\nIf successful, the gateway will respond by replaying all missed events in order, finishing with a [Resumed](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resumed) event to signal replay has finished, and all subsequent events are new. It\'s also possible that your client cannot reconnect in time to resume, in which case the client will receive a [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session) and is expected to wait a random amount of time—between 1 and 5 seconds—then send a fresh [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify).\n\n### Disconnections\n\nIf the gateway ever issues a disconnect to your client, it will provide a close event code that you can use to properly handle the disconnection. A full list of these close codes can be found in the [Response Codes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-close-event-codes) documentation.\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nClients are allowed 120 events every 60 seconds, meaning you can send on average at a rate of up to 2 events per second. Clients who surpass this limit are immediately disconnected from the Gateway, and similarly to the HTTP API, repeat offenders will have their API access revoked. Clients are also limited to one gateway connection per 5 seconds. If you hit this limit, the Gateway will respond with an [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session).\n\n## Tracking State\n\nMost of a client\'s state is provided during the initial [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) event and the [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events that immediately follow. As objects are further created/updated/deleted, other events are sent to notify the client of these changes and to provide the new or updated data. To avoid excessive API calls, Discord expects clients to locally cache as many object states as possible, and to update them as gateway events are received.\n\nAn example of state tracking can be found with member status caching. When initially connecting to the gateway, the client receives information regarding the online status of guild members (online, idle, dnd, offline). To keep this state updated, a client must track and parse [Presence Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update) events as they are received, and apply the provided data to the cached member objects.\n\n## Guild Availability\n\nWhen connecting to the gateway as a bot user, guilds that the bot is a part of start out as unavailable. Don\'t fret! The gateway will automatically attempt to reconnect on your behalf. As guilds become available to you, you will receive [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events.\n\n## Sharding\n\nAs bots grow and are added to an increasing number of guilds, some developers may find it necessary to break or split portions of their bots operations into separate logical processes. As such, Discord gateways implement a method of user-controlled guild sharding which allows for splitting events across a number of gateway connections. Guild sharding is entirely user controlled, and requires no state-sharing between separate connections to operate.\n\nTo enable sharding on a connection, the user should send the `shard` array in the [Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify) payload. The first item in this array should be the zero-based integer value of the current shard, while the second represents the total number of shards. DMs will only be sent to shard 0. To calculate what events will be sent to what shard, the following formula can be used:\n\n###### Sharding Formula\n\n```python\n(guild_id >> 22) % num_shards == shard_id\n```\n\nAs an example, if you wanted to split the connection between three shards, you\'d use the following values for `shard` for each connection: `[0, 3]`, `[1, 3]`, and `[2, 3]`. Note that only the first shard (`[0, 3]`) would receive DMs.\n\n## Sharding for Very Large Bots\n\nIf you own a bot that is in over 100,000 guilds, there are some additional considerations you must take around sharding. We will contact you if you are required to adhere to these changes.\n\nThe number of shards you run must be a multiple of a fixed number we will determine when reaching out to you. If you attempt to start your bot with an invalid number of shards, your websocket connection will close with a 4010 Invalid Shard opcode. The gateway bot bootstrap endpoint will return the correct amount of shards, so if you\'re already using this endpoint to determine your number of shards, you shouldn\'t require any further changes.\n\nThe session start limit for these bots will also be increased from 1000 to 2000 per day. Finally, the [Get Current User Guilds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user-guilds) endpoint will no longer return results for your bot. We will be creating a new endpoint that is more shard-aware to iterate through your bot\'s guilds if needed.\n\n## Commands and Events\n\nCommands are requests made to the gateway socket by a

Within the following documentation they have been left in standard English form to aid in readability.\n\n#### Identify\n\nUsed to trigger the initial handshake with the gateway.\n\n###### Identify Structure\n\n| Field            | Type                                                       | Description                                                                                                                    | Default |\n| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |\n| token            | string                                                     | authentication token                                                                                                           | -       |\n| properties       | object                                                     | [connection properties](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify-identify-connection-properties)                                          | -       |\n| compress?        | boolean                                                    | whether this connection supports compression of packets                                                                        | false   |\n| large_threshold? | integer                                                    | value between 50 and 250, total number of members where the gateway will stop sending offline members in the guild member list | 50      |\n| shard?           | array of two integers (shard_id, num_shards)               | used for [Guild Sharding](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sharding)                                                                       | -       |\n| presence?        | [update status](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-status) object | presence structure for initial presence information                                                                            | -       |\n\n###### Identify Connection Properties\n\n| Field     | Type   | Description           |\n| --------- | ------ | --------------------- |\n| \\$os      | string | your operating system |\n| \\$browser | string | your library name     |\n| \\$device  | string | your library name     |\n\n###### Example Identify\n\n```json\n{\n  "token": "my_token",\n  "properties": {\n    "$os": "linux",\n    "$browser": "disco",\n    "$device": "disco"\n  },\n  "compress": true,\n  "large_threshold": 250,\n  "shard": [0, 1],\n  "presence": {\n    "game": {\n      "name": "Cards Against Humanity",\n      "type": 0\n    },\n    "status": "dnd",\n    "since": 91879201,\n    "afk": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Resume\n\nUsed to replay missed events when a disconnected client resumes.\n\n###### Resume Structure\n\n| Field      | Type    | Description                   |\n| ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |\n| token      | string  | session token                 |\n| session_id | string  | session id                    |\n| seq        | integer | last sequence number received |\n\n###### Example Resume\n\n```json\n{\n  "token": "randomstring",\n  "session_id": "evenmorerandomstring",\n  "seq": 1337\n}\n```\n\n#### Heartbeat\n\nUsed to maintain an active gateway connection. Must be sent every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds after the [Opcode 10 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/hello) payload is received. The inner `d` key is the last sequence number—`s`—received by the client. If you have not yet received one, send `null`.\n\n###### Example Heartbeat\n\n```\n{\n\t"op": 1,\n\t"d": 251\n}\n```\n\n#### Request Guild Members\n\nUsed to request all members for a guild or a list of guilds. When initially connecting, the gateway will only send offline members if a guild has less than the `large_threshold` members (value in the [Gateway Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify)). If a client wishes to receive additional members, they need to explicitly request them via this operation. The server will send [Guild Members Chunk](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-members-chunk) events in response with up to 1000 members per chunk until all members that match the request have been sent.\n\n###### Guild Request Members Structure\n\n| Field    | Type                             | Description                                                                |\n| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| guild_id | snowflake or array of snowflakes | id of the guild(s) to get members for                                      |\n| query    | string                           | string that username starts with, or an empty string to return all members |\n| limit    | integer                          | maximum number of members to send or 0 to request all members matched      |\n\n###### Guild Request Members\n\n```json\n{\n  "guild_id": "41771983444115456",\n  "query": "",\n  "limit": 0\n}\n```\n\n#### Update Voice State\n\nSent when a client wants to join, move, or disconnect from a voice channel.\n\n###### Gateway Voice State Update Structure\n\n| Field      | Type       | Description                                                          |\n| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| guild_id   | snowflake  | id of the guild                                                      |\n| channel_id | ?snowflake | id of the voice channel client wants to join (null if disconnecting) |\n| self_mute  | boolean    | is the client muted                                                  |\n| self_deaf  | boolean    | is the client deafened                                               |\n\n###### Example Gateway Voice State Update\n\n```json\n{\n  "guild_id": "41771983423143937",\n  "channel_id": "127121515262115840",\n  "self_mute": false,\n  "self_deaf": false\n}\n```\n\n#### Update Status\n\nSent by the client to indicate a presence or status update.\n\n###### Gateway Status Update Structure\n\n| Field  | Type                                                     | Description                                                                                 |\n| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| since  | ?integer                                                 | unix time (in milliseconds) of when the client went idle, or null if the client is not idle |\n| game   | ?[activity](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/activity-object) object | null, or the user\'s new activity                                                            |\n| status | string                                                   | the user\'s new [status](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-status-status-types)                    |\n| afk    | boolean                                                  | whether or not the client is afk                                                            |\n\n###### Status Types\n\n| Status    | Description                    |\n| --------- | ------------------------------ |\n| online    | Online                         |\n| dnd       | Do Not Disturb                 |\n| idle      | AFK                            |\n| invisible | Invisible and shown as offline |\n| offline   | Offline                        |\n\n###### Example Gateway Status Update\n\n```json\n{\n  "since": 91879201,\n  "game": {\n    "name": "Save the Oxford Comma",\n    "type": 0\n  },\n  "status": "online",\n  "afk": false\n}\n```\n\n### Connecting and Resuming\n\n#### Hello\n\nSent on connection to the websocket. Defines the heartbeat interval that the client should heartbeat to.\n\n###### Hello Structure\n\n| Field              | Type             | Description                                                     |\n| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| heartbeat_interval | integer          | the interval (in milliseconds) the client should heartbeat with |\n| \\_trace            | array of strings | used for debugging, array of servers connected to               |\n\n###### Example Hello\n\n```json\n{\n  "heartbeat_interval": 45000,\n  "_trace": ["discord-gateway-prd-1-99"]\n}\n```\n\n#### Ready\n\nThe ready event is dispatched when a client has completed the initial handshake with the gateway (for new sessions). The ready event can be the largest and most complex event the gateway will send, as it contains all the state required for a client to begin interacting with the rest of the platform.\n\n`guilds` are the guilds of which your bot is a member. They start out as unavailable when you connect to the gateway. As they become available, your bot will be notified via [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events. `private_channels` will be an empty array. As bots receive private messages, they will be notified via [Channel Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-create) events.\n\n###### Ready Event Fields\n\n| Field            | Type                                                                                 | Description                                                                                                   |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| v                | integer                                                                              | [gateway protocol version](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-protocol-versions)                                    |\n| user             | [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) object                                      | information about the user including email                                                                    |\n| private_channels | array                                                                                | empty array                                                                                                   |\n| guilds           | array of [Unavailable Guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/unavailable-guild-object) objects | the guilds the user is in                                                                                     |\n| session_id       | string                                                                               | used for resuming connections                                                                                 |\n| \\_trace          | array of strings                                                                     | used for debugging - the guilds the user is in                                                                |\n| shard?           | array of two integers (shard_id, num_shards)\t                                      | the [shard information](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sharding) associated with this session, if sent when identifying |\n\n#### Resumed\n\nThe resumed event is dispatched when a client has sent a [resume payload](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume) to the gateway (for resuming existing sessions).\n\n###### Resumed Event Fields\n\n| Field   | Type             | Description                                    |\n| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| \\_trace | array of strings | used for debugging - the guilds the user is in |\n\n#### Invalid Session\n\nSent to indicate one of at least three different situations:\n\n- the gateway could not initialize a session after receiving an [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify)\n- the gateway could not resume a previous session after receiving an [Opcode 6 Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume)\n- the gateway has invalidated an active session and is requesting client action\n\nThe inner `d` key is a boolean that indicates whether the session may be resumable. See [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/connecting) and [Resuming](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resuming) for more information.\n\n###### Example Gateway Invalid Session\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 9,\n  "d": false\n}\n```\n\n### Channels\n\n#### Channel Create\n\nSent when a new channel is created, relevant to the current user. The inner payload is a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object.\n\n#### Channel Update\n\nSent when a channel is updated. The inner payload is a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object. This is not sent when the field `last_message_id` is altered. To keep track of the last_message_id changes, you must listen for [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) events.\n\n#### Channel Delete\n\nSent when a channel relevant to the current user is deleted. The inner payload is a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object.\n\n#### Channel Pins Update\n\nSent when a message is pinned or unpinned in a text channel. This is not sent when a pinned message is deleted.\n\n###### Channel Pins Update Event Fields\n\n| Field               | Type              | Description                                                 |\n| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| guild_id?           | snowflake         | the id of the guild                                         |\n| channel_id          | snowflake         | the id of the channel                                       |\n| last_pin_timestamp? | ISO8601 timestamp | the time at which the most recent pinned message was pinned |\n\n### Guilds\n\n#### Guild Create\n\nThis event can be sent in three different scenarios:\n\n1.  When a user is initially connecting, to lazily load and backfill information for all unavailable guilds sent in the [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) event.\n2.  When a Guild becomes available again to the client.\n3.  When the current user joins a new Guild.\n\nThe inner payload is a [guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object) object, with all the extra fields specified.\n\n#### Guild Update\n\nSent when a guild is updated. The inner payload is a [guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object) object.\n\n#### Guild Delete\n\nSent when a guild becomes unavailable during a guild outage, or when the user leaves or is removed from a guild.

Within Discord, there are multiple types of OAuth2 authentication. We support the authorization code grant, the implicit grant, client credentials, and some modified special-for-Discord flows for Bots and Webhooks\n\n## Shared Resources\n\nThe first step in implementing OAuth2 is [registering a developer application](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top) and retrieving your client ID and client secret. Most people who will be implementing OAuth2 will want to find and utilize a library in the language of their choice. For those implementing OAuth2 from scratch, please see [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for details. After you create your application with Discord, make sure that you have your `client_id` and `client_secret` handy. The next step is to figure out which OAuth2 flow is right for your purposes.\n\n###### OAuth2 URLs\n\n| URL | Description |\n|-----|-------------|\n| https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize | Base authorization URL |\n| https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/token | Token URL |\n| https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/token/revoke | Revocation URL |\n\n>warn\n>In accordance with [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749), the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) **only** accepts a content type of `x-www-form-urlencoded`. JSON content is not permitted and will return an error.\n\n###### OAuth2 Scopes\n\n| Name | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| bot | for oauth2 bots, this puts the bot in the user\'s selected guild by default |\n| connections | allows [/users/@me/connections](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-user-connections) to return linked third-party accounts |\n| email | enables [/users/@me](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user) to return an `email` |\n| identify | allows [/users/@me](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user) without `email` |\n| guilds | allows [/users/@me/guilds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user-guilds) to return basic information about all of a user\'s guilds |\n| guilds.join | allows [/guilds/{guild.id}/members/{user.id}](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/add-guild-member) to be used for joining users to a guild |\n| gdm.join | allows your app to [join users to a group dm](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/group-dm-add-recipient) |\n| messages.read | for local rpc server api access, this allows you to read messages from all client channels (otherwise restricted to channels/guilds your app creates) |\n| rpc | for local rpc server access, this allows you to control a user\'s local Discord client |\n| rpc.api | for local rpc server api access, this allows you to access the API as the local user |\n| rpc.notifications.read | for local rpc server api access, this allows you to receive notifications pushed out to the user |\n| webhook.incoming | this generates a webhook that is returned in the oauth token response for authorization code grants |\n\n>info\n>`guilds.join` and `bot` require you to have a bot account linked to your application. Also, in order to add a user to a guild, your bot has to already belong to that guild.\n\n## State and Security\n\nBefore we dive into the semantics of the different OAuth2 grants, we should stop and discuss security, specifically the use of the `state` parameter. [Cross Site Request Forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery), or CSRF, and [Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking) are security vulnerabilities that must be addressed by individuals implementing OAuth. This is typically accomplished using the `state` parameter. `state` is sent in the authorization request and returned back in the response and should be a value that binds the user\'s request to their authenticated state. For example, `state` could be a hash of the user\'s session cookie, or some other nonce that can be linked to the user\'s session.\n\nWhen a user begins an authorization flow on the client, a `state` is generated that is unique to that user\'s request. This value is stored somewhere only accessible to the client and the user, i.e. protected by the [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy). When the user is redirected, the `state` parameter is returned. The client validates the request by checking that the `state` returned matches the stored value. If they match, it is a valid authorization request. If they do not match, it\'s possible that someone intercepted the request or otherwise falsely authorized themselves to another user\'s resources, and the request should be denied.\n\nWhile Discord does not require the use of the `state` parameter, we support it and highly recommend that you implement it for the security of your own applications and data.\n\n## Authorization Code Grant\n\nThe authorization code grant is what most developers will recognize as "standard OAuth2" and involves retrieving an access code and exchanging it for a user\'s access token. It allows the authorization server to act as an intermediary between the client and the resource owner, so the resource owner\'s credentials are never shared directly with the client.\n\n###### Authorization URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=157730590492196864&scope=identify%20guilds.join&state=15773059ghq9183habn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnicememe.website\n```\n\n`client_id` is your application\'s `client_id`. `scope` is a list of [OAuth2 scopes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) separated by url encoded spaces (`%20`). `redirect_uri` is whatever URL you registered when creating your application, url-encoded. `state` is the unique string mentioned in [State and Security](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/state-and-security).\n\nWhen someone navigates to this URL, they will be prompted to authorize your application for the requested scopes. On acceptance, they will be redirected to your `redirect_uri`, which will contain an additional querystring parameter, `code`. `state` will also be returned if previously sent, and should be validated at this point.\n\n###### Redirect URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://nicememe.website/?code=NhhvTDYsFcdgNLnnLijcl7Ku7bEEeee&state=15773059ghq9183habn\n```\n\n`code` is now exchanged for the user\'s access token by making a `POST` request to the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) with the following parameters:\n\n- `client_id` - your application\'s client id\n- `client_secret` - your application\'s client secret\n- `grant_type` - must be set to `authorization_code`\n- `code` - the code from the querystring\n- `redirect_uri` - your `redirect_uri`\n- `scope` - the scopes requested in your authorization url, space-delimited\n\n###### Access Token Exchange Example\n\n```python\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \'https://discordapp.com/api/v6\'\nCLIENT_ID = \'332269999912132097\'\nCLIENT_SECRET = \'937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire\'\nREDIRECT_URI = \'https://nicememe.website\'\n\ndef exchange_code(code):\n  data = {\n    \'client_id\': CLIENT_ID,\n    \'client_secret\': CLIENT_SECRET,\n    \'grant_type\': \'authorization_code\',\n    \'code\': code,\n    \'redirect_uri\': REDIRECT_URI,\n    \'scope\': \'identify email connections\'\n  }\n  headers = {\n    \'Content-Type\': \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n  }\n  r = requests.post(\'%s/oauth2/token\' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers)\n  r.raise_for_status()\n  return r.json()\n```\n\nYou can also pass your `client_id` and `client_secret` as basic authentication with `client_id` as the username and `client_secret` as the password. In response, you will receive:\n\n###### Access Token Response\n\n```json\n{\n    "access_token": "6qrZcUqja7812RVdnEKjpzOL4CvHBFG",\n    "token_type": "Bearer",\n    "expires_in": 604800,\n    "refresh_token": "D43f5y0ahjqew82jZ4NViEr2YafMKhue",\n    "scope": "identify"\n}\n```\n\nHaving the user\'s access token allows your application to make certain requests to the API on their behalf, restricted to whatever scopes were requested. `expires_in` is how long, in seconds, until the returned access token expires, allowing you to anticipate the expiration and refresh the token. To refresh, make another `POST` request to the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) with the following parameters:\n\n- `client_id` - your application\'s client id\n- `client_secret` - your application\'s client secret\n- `grant_type` - must be set to `refresh_token`\n- `refresh_token` - the user\'s refresh token\n- `redirect_uri` - your `redirect_uri`\n- `scope` - the scopes requested in your authorization url, space-delimited\n\n###### Refresh Token Exchange Example\n\n```python\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \'https://discordapp.com/api/v6\'\nCLIENT_ID = \'332269999912132097\'\nCLIENT_SECRET = \'937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire\'\nREDIRECT_URI = \'https://nicememe.website\'\n\ndef refresh_token(refresh_token):\n  data = {\n    \'client_id\': CLIENT_ID,\n    \'client_secret\': CLIENT_SECRET,\n    \'grant_type\': \'refresh_token\',\n    \'refresh_token\': refresh_token,\n    \'redirect_uri\': REDIRECT_URI,\n    \'scope\': \'identify email connections\'\n  }\n  headers = {\n    \'Content-Type\': \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n  }\n  r = requests.post(\'%s/oauth2/token\' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers)\n  r.raise_for_status()\n  return r.json()\n```\n\nBoom; fresh [access token response](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant-access-token-response)!\n\n## Implicit Grant\n\nThe implicit OAuth2 grant is a simplified flow optimized for in-browser clients. Instead of issuing the client an authorization code to be exchanged for an access token, the client is directly issued an access token. The URL is formatted as follows:\n\n###### Authorization URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=290926444748734499&state=15773059ghq9183habn&scope=identify\n```\n\nOn redirect, your redirect URI will contain additional **URI fragments**: `access_token`, `token_type`, `expires_in`, `scope`, and [`state`](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/state-and-security)(if specified). **These are not querystring parameters.** Be mindful of the "#" character:\n\n###### Redirect URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://findingfakeurlsisprettyhard.tv/#access_token=RTfP0OK99U3kbRtHOoKLmJbOn45PjL&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=604800&scope=identify&state=15773059ghq9183habn\n```\n\nThere are tradeoffs in using the implicit grant flow. It is both quicker and easier to implement, but rather than exchanging a code and getting a token returned in a secure HTTP body, the access token is returned in the URI fragment, which makes it possibly exposed to unauthorized parties. **You also are not returned a refresh token, so the user must explicitly re-authorize once their token expires.**\n\n## Client Credentials Grant\n\nThe client credential flow is a quick and easy way for bot developers to get their own bearer tokens for testing purposes. By making a `POST` request to the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) with a grant type of `client_credentials`, you will be returned an access token for the bot owner. Therefore, always be super-extra-very-we-are-not-kidding-like-really-be-secure-make-sure-your-info-is-not-in-your-source-code careful with your `client_id` and `client_secret`. We don\'t take kindly to imposters around these parts.\n\nYou can specify scopes with the `scope` parameter, which is a list of [OAuth2 scopes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) separated by spaces:\n\n###### Client Credentials Token Request Example\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \'https://discordapp.com/api/v6\'\nCLIENT_ID = \'332269999912132097\'\nCLIENT_SECRET = \'937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire\'\n\ndef get_token():\n  data = {\n    \'grant_type\': \'client_credentials\',\n    \'scope\': \'identify connections\'\n  }\n  headers = {\n    \'Content-Type\': \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n  }\n  r = requests.post(\'%s/oauth2/token\' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers, auth=(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))\n  r.raise_for_status()\n  return r.json()\n```\n\nIn return, you will receive an access token (without a refresh token):\n\n###### Client Credentials Access Token Response\n\n```json\n{\n    "access_token": "6qrZcUqja7812RVdnEKjpzOL4CvHBFG",\n    "token_type": "Bearer",\n    "expires_in": 604800,\n    "scope": "identify connections"\n}\n```\n\n## Bots\n\nSo, what are bot accounts?\n\n### Bot vs User Accounts\n\nDiscord\'s API provides a separate type of user account dedicated to automation, called a bot account. Bot accounts can be created through the [applications page](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top), and are authenticated using a token (rather than a username and password). Unlike the normal OAuth2 flow, bot accounts have full access to all API routes without using bearer tokens, and can connect to the [Real Time Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways). Automating normal user accounts (generally called "self-bots") outside of the OAuth2/bot API is forbidden, and can result in an account termination if found.\n\nBot accounts have a few differences in comparison to normal user accounts, namely:\n\n1. Bots are added to guilds through the OAuth2 API, and cannot accept normal invites.\n2. Bots cannot have friends, nor be added to or join Group DMs.\n3. Bots do not have a maximum number of Guilds (unlike user accounts, which are limited to 100).\n4. Bots have an entirely separate set of [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits).\n\n### Bot Authorization Flow\n\nBot authorization is a special server-less and callback-less OAuth2 flow that makes it easy for users to add bots to guilds. The URL you create looks similar to what we use for full stack implementation:\n\n###### URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=157730590492196864&scope=bot&permissions=1\n```\n\nIn the case of bots, the `scope` parameter should be set to `bot`. There\'s also a new parameter, `permissions`, which is an integer corresponding to the [permission calculations](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions-bitwise-permission-flags) for the bot. You\'ll also notice the absence of `response_type` and `redirect_uri`. Bot authorization does not require these parameters because there is no need to retrieve the user\'s access token.\n\nWhen the user navigates to this page, they\'ll be prompted to add the bot to a guild in which they have proper permissions. On acceptance, the bot will be added. Super easy!\n\nIf your bot is super specific to your private clubhouse, or you just don\'t like sharing, you can leave the `Public Bot` option unchecked in your application\'s settings. If unchecked, only you can add the bot to guilds. If marked as public, anyone with your bot\'s URL can add it to guilds in which they have proper permissions.\n\n### Advanced Bot Authorization\n\nDevs can extend the bot authorization functionality. You can request additional scopes outside of `bot`, which will prompt a continuation into a complete [authorization code grant flow](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant) and add the ability to request the user\'s access token. If you request any scopes outside of `bot`, `response_type` is again mandatory; we will also automatically redirect the user to the first uri in your application\'s registered list unless `redirect_uri` is specified.\n\nWhen receiving the access code on redirect, there will be additional querystring parameters of `guild_id` and `permissions`. The `guild_id` parameter should only be used as a hint as to the relationship between your bot and a guild. To be sure of the relationship between your bot and the guild, consider requiring the Oauth2 code grant in your bot\'s settings. Enabling it requires anyone adding your bot to a server to go through a full OAuth2 [authorization code grant flow](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant). When you retrieve the user\'s access token, you\'ll also receive information about the guild to which your bot was added:\n\n###### Extended Bot Authorization Access Token Example\n\n```json\n{\n    "token_type": "Bearer",\n    "guild": {\n        "mfa_level": 0,\n        "emojis": [],\n        "application_id": null,\n        "name": "SomeTest",\n        "roles": [\n            {\n                "hoist": false,\n                "name": "@everyone",\n                "mentionable": false,\n                "color": 0,\n                "position": 0,\n                "id": "290926798626357250",\n                "managed": false,\n                "permissions": 49794241\n            }\n        ],\n        "afk_timeout": 300,\n        "system_channel_id": null,\n        "widget_channel_id": null,\n        "region": "us-east",\n        "default_message_notifications": 1,\n        "embed_channel_id": null,\n        "explicit_content_filter": 0,\n        "splash": null,\n        "features": [],\n        "afk_channel_id": null,\n        "widget_enabled": false,\n        "verification_level": 0,\n        "owner_id": "53908232999183680",\n        "embed_enabled": false,\n        "id": "2909267986347357250",\n        "icon": null\n    },\n    "access_token": "zMndOe7jFLXGawdlxMOdNvXjjOce5X",\n    "scope": "bot",\n    "expires_in": 604800,\n    "refresh_token": "mgp8qnvBwJcmadwgCYKyYD5CAzGAX4"\n}\n```\n\n### Two-Factor Authentication Requirement\n\nFor bots with [elevated permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/bitwise-permission-flags) (permissions with a `*` next to them), we enforce two-factor authentication on the owner\'s account when added to guilds that have server-wide 2FA enabled.\n\n## Webhooks\n\nDiscord\'s webhook flow is a specialized version of an [authorization code](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant) implementation. In this case, the `scope` querystring parameter needs to be set to `webhook.incoming`:\n\n###### URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=157730590492196864&scope=webhook.incoming&state=15773059ghq9183habn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnicememe.website\n```\n\nWhen the user navigates to this URL, they will be prompted to select a channel in which to allow the webhook. When the webhook is [executed](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK/execute-webhook), it will post its message into this channel. On acceptance, the user will be redirected to your `redirect_uri`. The URL will contain the `code` querystring parameter which should be [exchanged for an access token](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant-access-token-exchange-example). In return, you will receive a slightly modified token response:\n\n###### Webhook Token Response Example\n\n```json\n{\n    "token_type": "Bearer",\n    "access_token": "GNaVzEtATqdh173tNHEXY9ZYAuhiYxvy",\n    "scope": "webhook.incoming",\n    "expires_in": 604800,\n    "refresh_token": "PvPL7ELyMDc1836457XCDh1Y8jPbRm",\n    "webhook": {\n        "name": "testwebhook",\n        "url": "https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/347114750880120863/kKDdjXa1g9tKNs0-_yOwLyALC9gydEWP6gr9sHabuK1vuofjhQDDnlOclJeRIvYK-pj_",\n        "channel_id": "345626669224982402",\n        "token": "kKDdjXa1g9tKNs0-_yOwLyALC9gydEWP6gr9sHabuK1vuofjhQDDnlOclJeRIvYK-pj_",\n        "avatar": null,\n        "guild_id": "290926792226357250",\n        "id": "347114750880120863"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFrom this object, you should store the `webhook.token` and `webhook.id`. To execute a particular webhook, send a `POST` request to:\n\n###### Webhook Execution URL\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN\n```\n\nAny user that wishes to add your webhook to their channel will need to go through the full OAuth2 flow. A new webhook is created each time, so you will need to save the token and id. If you wish to send a message to all your webhooks, you\'ll need to iterate over each stored id:token combination and make `POST` requests to each one.

A set of base permissions can be configured at the guild level for different roles. When these roles are attached to users, they grant or revoke specific privileges within the guild. Along with the guild-level permissions, Discord also supports permission overwrites that can be assigned to individual guild roles or guild members on a per-channel basis.\n\nPermissions are stored within a 53-bit integer and are calculated using bitwise operations. The total permissions integer can be determined by ORing together each individual value, and flags can be checked using AND operations.\n\n```python\n# Permissions value that can Send Messages (0x800) and Add Reactions (0x40):\npermissions = 0x40 | 0x800 # 2112\n\n# Checking for flags that are set:\n(permissions & 0x40) == 0x40   # True\n(permissions & 0x800) == 0x800 # True\n\n# Kick Members (0x2) was not set:\n(permissions & 0x2) == 0x2 # False\n```\n\nAdditional logic is required when permission overwrites are involved; this is further explained below. For more information about bitwise operations and flags, see [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field).\n\nBelow is a table of all current permissions, their integer values in hexadecimal, brief descriptions of the privileges that they grant, and the channel type they apply to, if applicable.\n\n###### Bitwise Permission Flags\n\n| Permission | Value | Description | Channel Type |\n|------------|-------|-------------|--------------|\n| CREATE\\_INSTANT\\_INVITE | `0x00000001` | Allows creation of instant invites | T, V |\n| KICK\\_MEMBERS * | `0x00000002` | Allows kicking members | |\n| BAN\\_MEMBERS * | `0x00000004` | Allows banning members | |\n| ADMINISTRATOR * | `0x00000008` | Allows all permissions and bypasses channel permission overwrites | |\n| MANAGE\\_CHANNELS * | `0x00000010` | Allows management and editing of channels | T, V |\n| MANAGE\\_GUILD * | `0x00000020` | Allows management and editing of the guild | |\n| ADD\\_REACTIONS | `0x00000040` | Allows for the addition of reactions to messages | T |\n| VIEW\\_AUDIT\\_LOG | `0x00000080` | Allows for viewing of audit logs | |\n| VIEW\\_CHANNEL | `0x00000400` | Allows guild members to view a channel, which includes reading messages in text channels | T, V |\n| SEND\\_MESSAGES | `0x00000800` | Allows for sending messages in a channel | T |\n| SEND\\_TTS\\_MESSAGES | `0x00001000` | Allows for sending of `/tts` messages | T |\n| MANAGE\\_MESSAGES *  | `0x00002000` | Allows for deletion of other users messages | T |\n| EMBED\\_LINKS | `0x00004000` | Links sent by users with this permission will be auto-embedded | T |\n| ATTACH\\_FILES | `0x00008000` | Allows for uploading images and files | T |\n| READ\\_MESSAGE\\_HISTORY | `0x00010000` | Allows for reading of message history | T |\n| MENTION\\_EVERYONE | `0x00020000` | Allows for using the `@everyone` tag to notify all users in a channel, and the `@here` tag to notify all online users in a channel | T |\n| USE\\_EXTERNAL\\_EMOJIS | `0x00040000` | Allows the usage of custom emojis from other servers | T |\n| CONNECT | `0x00100000` | Allows for joining of a voice channel | V |\n| SPEAK | `0x00200000` | Allows for speaking in a voice channel | V |\n| MUTE\\_MEMBERS | `0x00400000` | Allows for muting members in a voice channel | V |\n| DEAFEN\\_MEMBERS | `0x00800000` | Allows for deafening of members in a voice channel | V |\n| MOVE\\_MEMBERS | `0x01000000` | Allows for moving of members between voice channels | V |\n| USE\\_VAD | `0x02000000` | Allows for using voice-activity-detection in a voice channel | V |\n| PRIORITY\\_SPEAKER | `0x00000100` | Allows for using priority speaker in a voice channel | V |\n| CHANGE\\_NICKNAME | `0x04000000` | Allows for modification of own nickname | |\n| MANAGE\\_NICKNAMES | `0x08000000` | Allows for modification of other users nicknames | |\n| MANAGE\\_ROLES * | `0x10000000` | Allows management and editing of roles | T, V |\n| MANAGE\\_WEBHOOKS * | `0x20000000` | Allows management and editing of webhooks | T, V |\n| MANAGE\\_EMOJIS * | `0x40000000` | Allows management and editing of emojis | | |\n\n**\\* These permissions require the owner account to use [two-factor authentication](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/twofactor-authentication-requirement) when used on a guild that has server-wide 2FA enabled.**\n\nNote that these internal permission names may be referred to differently by the Discord client. For example, "Manage Permissions" refers to MANAGE_ROLES, "Read Messages" refers to VIEW_CHANNEL, and "Use Voice Activity" refers to USE_VAD.\n\n## Permission Hierarchy\n\nHow permissions apply may at first seem intuitive, but there are some hidden restrictions that prevent bots from performing certain inappropriate actions based on a bot\'s highest role compared to its target\'s highest role. A bot\'s or user\'s highest role is its role that has the greatest position value in the guild, with the default @everyone role starting at 0. Permissions follow a hierarchy with the following rules:\n\n* A bot can grant roles to other users that are of a lower position than their highest role.\n* A bot can edit roles of a lower position than its highest role, but it can only grant permissions it has to those roles.\n* A bot can only sort roles lower than its highest role.\n* A bot can only kick/ban users whose highest role is lower than the bot\'s highest role.\n\nOtherwise, permissions do not obey the role hierarchy. For example, a user has two roles: A and B. A denies the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission on a #coolstuff channel. B allows the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission on the same #coolstuff channel. The user would ultimately be able to view the #coolstuff channel, regardless of the role positions.\n\n## Permission Overwrites\n\nCertain permissions can be applied to roles or directly to members on a channel-level by using permission overwrites. Applicable permissions are indicated by a **T** for text-channels or **V** for voice-channels in the table above.\n\nWhen using overwrites, there are cases where permission collisions could occur for a user; that is to say, the user may have certain overwrites with permissions that contradict each other or their guild-level role permissions. With this in mind, permissions are applied to users in the following hierarchy:\n\n1. Base permissions given to @everyone are applied at a guild level\n2. Permissions allowed to a user by their roles are applied at a guild level\n3. Overwrites that deny permissions for @everyone are applied at a channel level\n4. Overwrites that allow permissions for @everyone are applied at a channel level\n5. Overwrites that deny permissions for specific roles are applied at a channel level\n6. Overwrites that allow permissions for specific roles are applied at a channel level\n7. Member-specific overwrites that deny permissions are applied at a channel level\n8. Member-specific overwrites that allow permissions are applied at a channel level\n\nThe follow pseudocode demonstrates this process programmatically:\n\n```python\ndef compute_base_permissions(member, guild):\n    if guild.is_owner(member):\n        return ALL\n\n    role_everyone = guild.get_role(guild.id)  # get @everyone role\n    permissions = role_everyone.permissions\n\n    for role in member.roles:\n        permissions |= role.permissions\n\n    if permissions & ADMINISTRATOR == ADMINISTRATOR:\n        return ALL\n\n    return permissions\n\ndef compute_overwrites(base_permissions, member, channel):\n    # ADMINISTRATOR overrides any potential permission overwrites, so there is nothing to do here.\n    if base_permissions & ADMINISTRATOR == ADMINISTRATOR:\n        return ALL\n\n    permissions = base_permissions\n    overwrite_everyone = overwrites.get(channel.guild_id)  # Find (@everyone) role overwrite and apply it.\n    if overwrite_everyone:\n        permissions &= ~overwrite_everyone.deny\n        permissions |= overwrite_everyone.allow\n\n    # Apply role specific overwrites.\n    overwrites = channel.permission_overwrites\n    allow = NONE\n    deny = NONE\n    for role_id in member.roles:\n        overwrite_role = overwrites.get(role_id)\n        if overwrite_role:\n            allow |= overwrite_role.allow\n            deny |= overwrite_role.deny\n\n    permissions &= ~deny\n    permissions |= allow\n\n    # Apply member specific overwrite if it exist.\n    overwrite_member = overwrites.get(member.user_id)\n    if overwrite_member:\n        permissions &= ~overwrite_member.deny\n        permissions |= overwrite_member.allow\n\n    return permissions\n\ndef compute_permissions(member, channel):\n    base_permissions = compute_base_permissions(member, channel.guild)\n    return compute_overwrites(base_permissions, member, channel)\n```\n\n## Implicit Permissions\n\nPermissions in Discord are sometimes implicitly denied or allowed based on logical use. The two main cases are `VIEW_CHANNEL` and `SEND_MESSAGES` for text channels. Denying a user or a role `VIEW_CHANNEL` on a channel implicitly denies other permissions on the channel. Though permissions like `SEND_MESSAGES` are not explicitly denied for the user, they are ignored because the user cannot read messages in the channel.\n\nDenying `SEND_MESSAGES` implicitly denies `MENTION_EVERYONE`, `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES`, `ATTACH_FILES`, and `EMBED_LINKS`. Again, they are not explicitly denied when doing permissions calculations, but they are ignored because the user cannot do the base action of sending messages.\n\nThere may be other cases in which certain permissions implicitly deny or allow other permissions. In all cases, it is based on logical conclusions about how a user with certain permissions should or should not interact with Discord.\n\n## Permission Syncing\n\nPermissions with regards to categories and channels within categories are a bit tricky. Rather than inheritance, permissions are calculated by means of what we call Permission Syncing. If a child channel has the same permissions and overwrites (or lack thereof) as its parent category, the channel is considered "synced" to the category. Any further changes to a **parent category** will be reflected in its synced child channels. Any further changes to a **child channel** will cause it to become de-synced from its parent category, and its permissions will no longer change with changes to its parent category.\n\n### Role Object\n\nRoles represent a set of permissions attached to a group of users. Roles have unique names, colors, and can be "pinned" to the side bar, causing their members to be listed separately. Roles are unique per guild, and can have separate permission profiles for the global context (guild) and channel context. The `@everyone` role has the same ID as the guild it belongs to.\n\n###### Role Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| id | snowflake | role id |\n| name | string | role name |\n| color | integer | integer representation of hexadecimal color code |\n| hoist | boolean | if this role is pinned in the user listing |\n| position | integer | position of this role |\n| permissions | integer | permission bit set |\n| managed | boolean | whether this role is managed by an integration |\n| mentionable | boolean | whether this role is mentionable |\n\nRoles without colors (`color == 0`) do not count towards the final computed color in the user list.\n\n###### Example Role\n\n```json\n{\n\t"id": "41771983423143936",\n\t"name": "WE DEM BOYZZ!!!!!!",\n\t"color": 3447003,\n\t"hoist": true,\n\t"position": 1,\n\t"permissions": 66321471,\n\t"managed": false,\n\t"mentionable": false\n}\n```\n'},2007:function(e,n){e.exports='# RPC\n\n> danger\n> For now, RPC is in a private beta.

When you create an app on our Developers site, you must specify an "RPC Origin" and "Redirect URI" from which to permit connections and authorizations. **The origin you send when connecting and the redirect uri you send when exchanging an authorization code for an access token must match one of the ones entered on the Developers site.**\n\nWhen establishing a WebSocket connection, we verify the Origin header on connection to prevent client ID spoofing. You will be instantly disconnected if the Origin does not match.\n\nIf you\'re connecting to the RPC server from within a browser, RPC origins are usually in the form `SCHEME://HOST[:PORT]`, where `SCHEME` is typically https or http, `HOST` is your domain or ip, and `PORT` is the port of the webserver from which the user will be connecting (omitted for ports 80 and 443). For example, `https://discordapp.com` would be used if the user were connecting from `https://discordapp.com/some/page/url`.\n\nIf you\'re connecting to the RPC server from within a non-browser application (like a game), you just need to make sure that the origin is sent with the upgrade request when connecting to the WebSocket. For local testing, we recommend testing with an origin like `https://localhost`. For production apps, we recommend setting the origin to your company/game\'s domain, for example `https://discordapp.com`.\n\n### RPC Server Ports\n\nThe port range for Discord\'s local RPC server is [6463, 6472]. Since the RPC server runs locally, there\'s a chance it might not be able to obtain its preferred port when it tries to bind to one. For this reason, the local RPC server will pick one port out of a range of these 10 ports, trying sequentially until it can bind to one. When implementing your client, you should perform the same sequential checking to find the correct port to connect to.\n\n## Authenticating\n\nIn order to call any commands over RPC, you must be authenticated or you will receive a code `4006` error response. Thankfully, we\'ve removed the oppressive nature of a couple commands that will let you `AUTHORIZE` and `AUTHENTICATE` new users. First, call [AUTHORIZE](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/authorize):\n\n###### RPC Authorize Example\n\n```json\n{\n  "nonce": "f48f6176-4afb-4c03-b1b8-d960861f5216",\n  "args": {\n    "client_id": "192741864418312192",\n    "scopes": ["rpc.api", "rpc", "identify"]\n  },\n  "cmd": "AUTHORIZE"\n}\n```\n\nThe user will then be prompted to authorize your app to access RPC on Discord. The `AUTHORIZE` command returns a `code` that you can exchange with a POST to `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/token` containing the [standard OAuth2 body parameters](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3) for the token exchange. The token endpoint on our API will return an `access_token` that can be sent with [AUTHENTICATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/authenticate):\n\n###### RPC Authenticate Example\n\n```json\n{\n  "nonce": "5bb10a43-1fdc-4391-9512-0c8f4aa203d4",\n  "args": {\n    "access_token": "CZhtkLDpNYXgPH9Ml6shqh2OwykChw"\n  },\n  "cmd": "AUTHENTICATE"\n}\n```\n\nYou can now call RPC commands on behalf of the authorized user!\n\n## Proxied API Requests\n\nIf you request the `rpc.api` [scope](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) when authorizing your app to the client, your app is able to call the Discord API on behalf of the user whose access token you retrieved.\n\nFor proxied API requests, the schema, host, and path to the API endpoint is always `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/` where `PORT` is the same port on which the RPC server is listening.\n\nProxied API requests accept an OAuth2 Bearer token in the Authorization header and respond as our API normally does. However, they are executed with the user\'s bearer token instead of a bot token, providing the ability to modify most of what the client has access to.\n\n###### Example RPC Proxy Call\n\n```\ncurl -H \'Authorization: Bearer CZhtkLDpNYXgPH9Ml6shqh2OwykChw\' http://127.0.0.1:6463/users/@me/guilds\n\n[{\n    "owner": true,\n    "permissions": 2146958399,\n    "icon": "2d68b25aa5d1eead693432a5f0077dff",\n    "id": "199737254929760256",\n    "name": "test"\n}]\n```\n\nCertain endpoints deemed potentially unsafe—like authorization and user management—are blocked. Check out the [rest of our API docs](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/reference) to learn more about interfacing with our REST API.\n\n## Commands and Events\n\nCommands are requests made to the

AUTHORIZE\n\nUsed to authenticate a new client with your app. By default this pops up a modal in-app that asks the user to authorize access to your app.\n\n**We currently do not allow access to RPC for unapproved games without an entry on a game\'s whitelist.** We grant 50 whitelist spots, which should be ample for development and testing. After approval, this restriction is removed and the whitelist is no longer needed.\n\nWe also have an RPC token system to bypass the user authorization modal. This is usable by approved games as well as by users on a game\'s whitelist, and also disallows use of the `messages.read` scope. If you have been granted access, you can send a POST request to `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/token/rpc` with your application\'s `client_id` and `client_secret` in the body (sent as a url-encoded body, **not JSON**). You can then pass the returned `rpc_token` value to the `rpc_token` field in your RPC authorize request (documented below).\n\n###### Authorize Argument Structure\n\n| Field     | Type

keyboard shortcut entered by the user.\n\nThis command is asynchronously returned. You capture a shortcut by first sending the `START` action. Then, the user is free to press keys while we log the shortcut key codes for you. As they press keys, we will emit a [CAPTURE_SHORTCUT_CHANGE](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/captureshortcutchange) event with the updated key codes. **When the user finishes, you then need to finish capturing by sending the `STOP` action.**\n\nReturns the shortcut captured, and `null` for the `STOP` action.\n\nNote: The `START` call will return the captured shortcut in its `data` object, while the `STOP` call will have no `data`.\n\n###### Capture Shortcut Argument Structure\n\n| Field  | Type   | Description                       |\n| ------ | ------ | --------------------------------- |\n| action |

Limits\n\nDiscord\'s API rate limits requests in order to prevent abuse and overload of our services. Rate limits are applied on a per-route basis (meaning they can be different for each route called), with the exception of an additional global rate limit spanning across the entire API. Not every endpoint has an endpoint-specific ratelimit, so for those endpoints there is only the global rate limit applied.\n\nBy "per-route," we mean that unique rate limits exist for the path you are accessing on our API, not including the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and including major parameters. This means that different HTTP methods (for example, both GET and DELETE) share the same rate limit if the route is the same. Additionally, rate limits take into account major parameters in the URL. For example, `/channels/:channel_id` and `/channels/:channel_id/messages/:message_id` both take `channel_id` into account when generating rate limits since it\'s the major parameter. Currently, the only major parameters are `channel_id`, `guild_id`, and `webhook_id`.\n\n>warn\n>There is currently a single exception to the above rule regarding different HTTP methods sharing the same rate limit, and that is for the [deletion of messages](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/delete-message). Deleting messages falls under a separate, higher rate limit so that bots are able to more quickly delete content from channels (which is useful for moderation bots).\n\nBecause we may change rate limits at any time and rate limits can be different per application, *rate limits should not be hard coded into your bot/application*. In order to properly support our dynamic rate limits, your bot/application should parse for our rate limits in response headers and locally prevent exceeding of the limits as they change.\n\n>warn\n>[Routes for controlling emojis](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/list-guild-emojis) do not follow the normal rate limit conventions. These routes are specifically limited on a per-guild basis to prevent abuse. This means that the quota returned by our APIs may be inaccurate, and you may encounter 429s.\n\n## Header Format\n\nFor every API request made, we return optional HTTP response headers containing the rate limit encountered during your request.\n\n###### Rate Limit Header Examples\n\n```\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 5\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 0\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1470173023\n```\n\n* **X-RateLimit-Global** - Returned only on a HTTP 429 response if the rate limit headers returned are of the global rate limit (not per-route)\n* **X-RateLimit-Limit** - The number of requests that can be made\n* **X-RateLimit-Remaining** - The number of remaining requests that can be made\n* **X-RateLimit-Reset** - Epoch time (seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970) at which the rate limit resets\n\n## Exceeding A Rate Limit\n\nIn the case that a rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a HTTP 429 response code with a JSON body.\n\n###### Rate Limit Response Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| message | string | A message saying you are being rate limited. |\n| retry_after | integer | The number of milliseconds to wait before submitting another request. |\n| global | boolean | A value indicating if you are being globally rate limited or not |\n\nNote that the normal rate-limiting headers will be sent in this response.

On other platforms, these may be referred to as \"organizations\", \"companies\", or \"teams\". We went with the name Teams because it best encompassed all the awesome conglomerates of devs that work together to make awesome things on Discord. Also, we never got picked for kickball in gym class, so now we get to be on a team.\n\n## What Do They Do\n\nTeams allow you and other Discord users to share access to apps. No more sharing login credentials in order to reset the token on a bot that your friend owns but you work on, or other such cases.\n\nFor game developers, this means that you can get your engineers access to your app for credentials they made need, your marketing folks access to store page management, and your finance people access to sales and performance metrics.\n\n> danger\n> For the initial release, Teams only support one kind of user: Admin. Admins have full access to all parts of an app _except_ for deleting the app. That can only be done by the owner of the Team.\n\n## How Do I Make One\n\nMaking a Team is easy! Head on over to our [Team creation](https://discordapp.com/developers/teams) page and make your own.\n\n![](team-page.png)\n\nNote that to use Discord Teams, you need to have 2FA enabled on your account. Security is of the utmost importance, especially when it comes to shared resources. If you're developing on your own and don't want to use Teams, you do not need 2FA. But, to keep other Team members safe, you'll need to add it to use Teams.\n\n![](team-2fa.png)\n\nOnce your team is made, you can start inviting other Discord users to join.\n\n> info\n> For the initial release, only the Team owner can invite additional users.\n\n## Apps on Teams\n\nNow that you've got your Team set up, you can start creating apps under it. Teams can own a maximum of 25 apps. To create a new app under a Team, select the Team in the app creation modal. If you want to keep the app under your own ownership, choose `Personal`:\n\n![](team-make-app.png)\n\nIf you have an existing app that you want to transfer to a Team, you can do that, too! Just go into the app that you want to transfer, hit `Transfer App to Team`, and send the app to its new home.\n\n![](transfer-app-to-team.png)\n\n> danger\n> Once an app has been transferred to a team, it _cannot_ be transferred back.\n\n## What Next\n\nWhat next? Go make awesome stuff! Whether you're a Game Developer, Mad Bot Scientist, or OAuth2 Enthusiast, you can now work together with other like-minded Discordians to bring your creations to life.\n\nWe've got a lot of awesome features planned for teams in the future, so stay tuned for things like:\n\n- Roles and Permissions\n- Audit Logs\n- More cat pictures\n\nGo team!\n"},2010:function(e,n){e.exports='# Voice\n\nVoice connections operate in a similar fashion to the [Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways) connection. However, they use a different set of payloads and a separate UDP-based connection for voice data transmission. Because UDP is used for both receiving and transmitting voice data, your client _must_ be able to receive UDP packets, even through a firewall or NAT (see [UDP Hole Punching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching) for more information).

Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the [Opcodes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) documented here will reflect what you receive over the socket.\n\n###### Gateway Versions\n\n| Version | Status | WebSocket URL Append |\n| ------- | ------ | -------------------- |\n| 3 | recommended | ?v=3 |\n| 2 | available | ?v=2 |\n| 1 | default | ?v=1 or omit |\n\n## Connecting to Voice\n\n### Retrieving Voice Server Information\n\nThe first step in connecting to a voice server (and in turn, a guild\'s voice channel) is formulating a request that can be sent to the [Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways), which will return information about the voice server we will connect to. Because Discord\'s voice platform is widely distributed, users **should never** cache or save the results of this call. To inform the gateway of our intent to establish voice connectivity, we first send an [Opcode 4 Gateway Voice State Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-voice-state-update):\n\n###### Gateway Voice State Update Example\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 4,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"guild_id": "41771983423143937",\n\t\t"channel_id": "127121515262115840",\n\t\t"self_mute": false,\n\t\t"self_deaf": false\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIf our request succeeded, the gateway will respond with _two_ events—a [Voice State Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/voice-state-update) event and a [Voice Server Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/voice-server-update) event—meaning your library must properly wait for both events before continuing. The first will contain a new key, `session_id`, and the second will provide voice server information we can use to establish a new voice connection:\n\n###### Example Voice Server Update Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"t": "VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE",\n\t"s": 2,\n\t"op": 0,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"token": "my_token",\n\t\t"guild_id": "41771983423143937",\n\t\t"endpoint": "smart.loyal.discord.gg"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nWith this information, we can move on to establishing a voice websocket connection.\n\n> info\n> Bot users respect the voice channel\'s user limit, if set. When the voice channel is full, you will not receive\n> the Voice State Update or Voice Server Update events in response to your own Voice State Update. Having `MANAGE_CHANNELS`\n> permission bypasses this limit and allows you to join regardless of the channel being full or not.\n\n## Establishing a Voice Websocket Connection\n\nOnce we retrieve a session\\_id, token, and endpoint information, we can connect and handshake with the voice server over another secure websocket. Unlike the gateway endpoint we receive in an HTTP [Get Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway) request, the endpoint received from our [Voice Server Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/voice-server-update) payload does not contain a URL protocol, so some libraries may require manually prepending it with "wss://" before connecting. Once connected to the voice websocket endpoint, we can send an [Opcode 0 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload with our server\\_id, user\\_id, session\\_id, and token:\n\n###### Example Voice Identify Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 0,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"server_id": "41771983423143937",\n\t\t"user_id": "104694319306248192",\n\t\t"session_id": "my_session_id",\n\t\t"token": "my_token"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThe voice server should respond with an [Opcode 2 Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload, which informs us of the `ssrc`, UDP IP/port, and supported encryption modes the voice server expects:\n\n###### Example Voice Ready Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 2,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"ssrc": 1,\n\t\t"ip": "127.0.0.1",\n\t\t"port": 1234,\n\t\t"modes": ["plain", "xsalsa20_poly1305"],\n\t\t"heartbeat_interval": 1\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n>danger\n>`heartbeat_interval` here is an erroneous field and should be ignored. The correct heartbeat_interval value comes from the Hello payload.\n\n## Heartbeating\n\nIn order to maintain your websocket connection, you need to continuously send heartbeats at the interval determined in [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes):\n\n###### Example Hello Payload Below V3\n\n```json\n{\n\t"heartbeat_interval": 41250\n}\n```\n\n###### Example Hello Payload V3\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 8,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"heartbeat_interval": 41250\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n>danger\n>There is currently a bug in the Hello payload heartbeat interval. Until it is fixed, please take your heartbeat interval as `heartbeat_interval` * .75. This warning will be removed and a changelog published when the bug is fixed.\n\nThis is sent at the start of the connection. Be warned that the [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) structure differs by gateway version as shown in the above examples. Versions below v3 do not have an opcode or a data field denoted by `d`. V3 is updated to be structured like other payloads. Be sure to expect this different format based on your version.\n\nAfter receiving [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes), you should send [Opcode 3 Heartbeat](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes)—which contains an integer nonce—every elapsed interval:\n\n###### Example Heartbeat Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 3,\n\t"d": 1501184119561\n}\n```\n\nIn return, you will be sent back an [Opcode 6 Heartbeat ACK](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) that contains the previously sent nonce:\n\n###### Example Heartbeat ACK Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 6,\n\t"d": 1501184119561\n}\n```\n\n## Establishing a Voice UDP Connection\n\nOnce we receive the properties of a UDP voice server from our [Opcode 2 Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload, we can proceed to the final step of voice connections, which entails establishing and handshaking a UDP connection for voice data. First, we open a UDP connection to the IP and port provided in the Ready payload. If required, we can now perform an [IP Discovery](#DOCS_RESOURCES_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/ip-discovery) using this connection. Once we\'ve fully discovered our external IP and UDP port, we can then tell the voice websocket what it is, and start receiving/sending data. We do this using [Opcode 1 Select Protocol](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes):\n\n>warn\n>The plain mode is no longer supported. All data should be sent using a supported encryption method, right now only `xsalsa20_poly1305`.\n\n###### Example Select Protocol Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 1,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"protocol": "udp",\n\t\t"data": {\n\t\t\t"address": "127.0.0.1",\n\t\t\t"port": 1337,\n\t\t\t"mode": "xsalsa20_poly1305"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the voice server will respond with a [Opcode 4 Session Description](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) that includes the `mode` and `secret_key`, a 32 byte array used for [encrypting and sending](#DOCS_RESOURCES_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/encrypting-and-sending-voice) voice data:\n\n###### Example Session Description Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 4,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"mode": "xsalsa20_poly1305",\n\t\t"secret_key": [ ...251, 100, 11...]\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n We can now start encrypting and sending voice data over the previously established UDP connection.\n\n## Encrypting and Sending Voice\n\nVoice data sent to discord should be encoded with [Opus](https://www.opus-codec.org/), using two channels (stereo) and a sample rate of 48kHz. Voice Data is sent using a [RTP Header](http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc3550_line548), followed by encrypted Opus audio data. Voice encryption uses the key passed in [Opcode 4 Session Description](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) combined with the 24 byte header (used as a nonce, appended with 12 null bytes), encrypted with [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/):\n\n###### Encrypted Voice Packet Header Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Size |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| Type | Single byte value of `0x80` | 1 byte |\n| Version | Single byte value of `0x78` | 1 byte |\n| Sequence | unsigned short (big endian) | 2 bytes |\n| Timestamp | unsigned integer (big endian) | 4 bytes |\n| SSRC | unsigned integer (big endian) | 4 bytes |\n\n## Speaking\n\nTo notify clients that you are speaking or have stopped speaking, send an [Opcode 5 Speaking](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload:\n\n###### Example Speaking Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 5,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"speaking": true,\n\t\t"delay": 0,\n\t\t"ssrc": 1\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n>warn\n>You must send at least one [Opcode 5 Speaking](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload before sending voice data, or you will be disconnected with an invalid SSRC error.\n\n### Voice Data Interpolation\n\nWhen there\'s a break in the sent data, the packet transmission shouldn\'t simply stop. Instead, send five frames of silence (`0xF8, 0xFF, 0xFE`) before stopping to avoid unintended Opus interpolation with subsequent transmissions.\n\n## Resuming Voice Connection\n\nWhen your client detects that its connection has been severed, it should open a new websocket connection. Once the new connection has been opened, your client should send an [Opcode 7 Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload:\n\n###### Example Resume Connection Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 7,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"server_id": "41771983423143937",\n\t\t"session_id": "my_session_id",\n\t\t"token": "my_token"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIf successful, the Voice server will respond with an [Opcode 9 Resumed](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) and an [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) to signal that your client is now reconnected:\n\n###### Example Resumed Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 9,\n\t"d": null\n}\n```\n\nIf the resume is unsuccessful—for example, due to an invalid session—the websocket connection will close with the appropriate [close event code](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-close-event-codes). You should then follow the [Connecting](#DOCS_RESOURCES_VOICE_CONNECTS/connecting-to-voice) flow to reconnect.\n\n#### IP Discovery\n\nGenerally routers on the internet mask or obfuscate UDP ports through a process called NAT. Most users who implement voice will want to utilize IP discovery to find their external IP and port which will then be used for receiving voice communications. To retrieve your external IP and port, send a 70-byte packet with empty data past the 4-byte ssrc. The server will respond back with another 70-byte packet, this time with a NULL-terminated string of the IP, with the port encoded in a **little endian** unsigned short stored in the last two bytes of the packet.\n'}}]);
