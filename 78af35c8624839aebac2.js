However, they use a different set of payloads and a separate UDP-based connection for voice data transmission. Because UDP is used for both receiving and transmitting voice data, your client _must_ be able to receive UDP packets, even through a firewall or NAT (see [UDP Hole Punching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching) for more information). The Discord Voice servers implement functionality (see [IP Discovery](#DOCS_RESOURCES_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/ip-discovery)) for discovering the local machines remote UDP IP/Port, which can assist in some network configurations.\n\n## Voice Gateway Versioning\n\nTo ensure that you have the most up-to-date information, please use [version 3](#DOCS_RESOURCES_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/voice-gateway-versioning-gateway-versions). Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the [Opcodes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) documented here will reflect what you receive over the socket.\n\n###### Gateway Versions\n\n| Version | Status | WebSocket URL Append |\n| ------- | ------ | -------------------- |\n| 3 | recommended | ?v=3 |\n| 2 | available | ?v=2 |\n| 1 | default | ?v=1 or omit |\n\n## Connecting to Voice\n\n### Retrieving Voice Server Information\n\nThe first step in connecting to a voice server (and in turn, a guild\'s voice channel) is formulating a request that can be sent to the [Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways), which will return information about the voice server we will connect to. Because Discord\'s voice platform is widely distributed, users **should never** cache or save the results of this call. To inform the gateway of our intent to establish voice connectivity, we first send an [Opcode 4 Gateway Voice State Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-voice-state-update):\n\n###### Gateway Voice State Update Example\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 4,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"guild_id": "41771983423143937",\n\t\t"channel_id": "127121515262115840",\n\t\t"self_mute": false,\n\t\t"self_deaf": false\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIf our request succeeded, the gateway will respond with _two_ events—a [Voice State Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/voice-state-update) event and a [Voice Server Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/voice-server-update) event—meaning your library must properly wait for both events before continuing. The first will contain a new key, `session_id`, and the second will provide voice server information we can use to establish a new voice connection:\n\n###### Example Voice Server Update Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"t": "VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE",\n\t"s": 2,\n\t"op": 0,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"token": "my_token",\n\t\t"guild_id": "41771983423143937",\n\t\t"endpoint": "smart.loyal.discord.gg"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nWith this information, we can move on to establishing a voice websocket connection.\n\n## Establishing a Voice Websocket Connection\n\nOnce we retrieve a session\\_id, token, and endpoint information, we can connect and handshake with the voice server over another secure websocket. Unlike the gateway endpoint we receive in an HTTP [Get Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway) request, the endpoint received from our [Voice Server Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/voice-server-update) payload does not contain a URL protocol, so some libraries may require manually prepending it with "wss://" before connecting. Once connected to the voice websocket endpoint, we can send an [Opcode 0 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload with our server\\_id, user\\_id, session\\_id, and token:\n\n###### Example Voice Identify Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 0,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"server_id": "41771983423143937",\n\t\t"user_id": "104694319306248192",\n\t\t"session_id": "my_session_id",\n\t\t"token": "my_token"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThe voice server should respond with an [Opcode 2 Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload, which informs us of the `ssrc`, UDP IP/port, and supported encryption modes the voice server expects:\n\n###### Example Voice Ready Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 2,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"ssrc": 1,\n\t\t"ip": "127.0.0.1",\n\t\t"port": 1234,\n\t\t"modes": ["plain", "xsalsa20_poly1305"],\n\t\t"heartbeat_interval": 1\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n>danger\n>`heartbeat_interval` here is an erroneous field and should be ignored. The correct heartbeat_interval value comes from the Hello payload.\n\n## Heartbeating\n\nIn order to maintain your websocket connection, you need to continuously send heartbeats at the interval determined in [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes):\n\n###### Example Hello Payload Below V3\n\n```json\n{\n\t"heartbeat_interval": 41250\n}\n```\n\n###### Example Hello Payload V3\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 8,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"heartbeat_interval": 41250\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n>danger\n>There is currently a bug in the Hello payload heartbeat interval. Until it is fixed, please take your heartbeat interval as `heartbeat_interval` * .75. This warning will be removed and a changelog published when the bug is fixed.\n\nThis is sent at the start of the connection. Be warned that the [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) structure differs by gateway version as shown in the above examples. Versions below v3 do not have an opcode or a data field denoted by `d`. V3 is updated to be structured like other payloads. Be sure to expect this different format based on your version.\n\nAfter receiving [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes), you should send [Opcode 3 Heartbeat](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes)—which contains an integer nonce—every elapsed interval:\n\n###### Example Heartbeat Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 3,\n\t"d": 1501184119561\n}\n```\n\nIn return, you will be sent back an [Opcode 6 Heartbeat ACK](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) that contains the previously sent nonce:\n\n###### Example Heartbeat ACK Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 6,\n\t"d": 1501184119561\n}\n```\n\n## Establishing a Voice UDP Connection\n\nOnce we receive the properties of a UDP voice server from our [Opcode 2 Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload, we can proceed to the final step of voice connections, which entails establishing and handshaking a UDP connection for voice data. First, we open a UDP connection to the IP and port provided in the Ready payload. If required, we can now perform an [IP Discovery](#DOCS_RESOURCES_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/ip-discovery) using this connection. Once we\'ve fully discovered our external IP and UDP port, we can then tell the voice websocket what it is, and start receiving/sending data. We do this using [Opcode 1 Select Protocol](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes):\n\n>warn\n>The plain mode is no longer supported. All data should be sent using a supported encryption method, right now only `xsalsa20_poly1305`.\n\n###### Example Select Protocol Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 1,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"protocol": "udp",\n\t\t"data": {\n\t\t\t"address": "127.0.0.1",\n\t\t\t"port": 1337,\n\t\t\t"mode": "xsalsa20_poly1305"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the voice server will respond with a [Opcode 4 Session Description](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) that includes the `mode` and `secret_key`, a 32 byte array used for [encrypting and sending](#DOCS_RESOURCES_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/encrypting-and-sending-voice) voice data:\n\n###### Example Session Description Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 4,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"mode": "xsalsa20_poly1305",\n\t\t"secret_key": [ ...251, 100, 11...]\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n We can now start encrypting and sending voice data over the previously established UDP connection.\n\n## Encrypting and Sending Voice\n\nVoice data sent to discord should be encoded with [Opus](https://www.opus-codec.org/), using two channels (stereo) and a sample rate of 48kHz. Voice Data is sent using a [RTP Header](http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc3550_line548), followed by encrypted Opus audio data. Voice encryption uses the key passed in [Opcode 4 Session Description](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) combined with the 24 byte header (used as a nonce, appended with 12 null bytes), encrypted with [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/):\n\n###### Encrypted Voice Packet Header Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Size |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| Type | Single byte value of `0x80` | 1 byte |\n| Version | Single byte value of `0x78` | 1 byte |\n| Sequence | unsigned short (big endian) | 2 bytes |\n| Timestamp | unsigned int (big endian) | 4 bytes |\n| SSRC | unsigned int (big endian) | 4 bytes |\n\n## Speaking\n\nTo notify clients that you are speaking or have stopped speaking, send an [Opcode 5 Speaking](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload:\n\n###### Example Speaking Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 5,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"speaking": true,\n\t\t"delay": 0,\n\t\t"ssrc": 1\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n>warn\n>You must send at least one [Opcode 5 Speaking](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload before sending voice data, or you will be disconnected with an invalid SSRC error.\n\n### Voice Data Interpolation\n\nWhen there\'s a break in the sent data, the packet transmission shouldn\'t simply stop. Instead, send five frames of silence (`0xF8, 0xFF, 0xFE`) before stopping to avoid unintended Opus interpolation with subsequent transmissions.\n\n## Resuming Voice Connection\n\nWhen your client detects that its connection has been severed, it should open a new websocket connection. Once the new connection has been opened, your client should send an [Opcode 7 Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) payload:\n\n###### Example Resume Connection Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 7,\n\t"d": {\n\t\t"server_id": "41771983423143937",\n\t\t"session_id": "my_session_id",\n\t\t"token": "my_token"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIf successful, the Voice server will respond with an [Opcode 9 Resumed](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) and an [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-opcodes) to signal that your client is now reconnected:\n\n###### Example Resumed Payload\n\n```json\n{\n\t"op": 9,\n\t"d": null\n}\n```\n\nIf the resume is unsuccessful—for example, due to an invalid session—the websocket connection will close with the appropriate [close event code](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-close-event-codes). You should then follow the [Connecting](#DOCS_RESOURCES_VOICE_CONNECTS/connecting-to-voice) flow to reconnect.\n\n#### IP Discovery\n\nGenerally routers on the internet mask or obfuscate UDP ports through a process called NAT. Most users who implement voice will want to utilize IP discovery to find their external IP and port which will then be used for receiving voice communications. To retrieve your external IP and port, send a 70-byte packet with empty data past the 4-byte ssrc. The server will respond back with another 70-byte packet, this time with a NULL-terminated string of the IP, with the port encoded in a **little endian** unsigned short stored in the last two bytes of the packet.\n'},1797:function(e,n){e.exports='# Rate Limits\n\nDiscord\'s API rate limits requests in order to prevent abuse and overload of our services. Rate limits are applied on a per-route basis (meaning they can be different for each route called), with the exception of an additional global rate limit spanning across the entire API. Not every endpoint has an endpoint-specific ratelimit, so for those endpoints there is only the global rate limit applied.\n\nBy "per-route," we mean that unique rate limits exist for the path you are accessing on our API, not including the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and including major parameters. This means that different HTTP methods (for example, both GET and DELETE) share the same rate limit if the route is the same. Additionally, rate limits take into account major parameters in the URL. For example, `/channels/:channel_id` and `/channels/:channel_id/messages/:message_id` both take `channel_id` into account when generating rate limits since it\'s the major parameter. Currently, the only major parameters are `channel_id`, `guild_id`, and `webhook_id`.\n\n>warn\n>There is currently a single exception to the above rule regarding different HTTP methods sharing the same rate limit, and that is for the [deletion of messages](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/delete-message). Deleting messages falls under a separate, higher rate limit so that bots are able to more quickly delete content from channels (which is useful for moderation bots).\n\nBecause we may change rate limits at any time and rate limits can be different per application, *rate limits should not be hard coded into your bot/application*. In order to properly support our dynamic rate limits, your bot/application should parse for our rate limits in response headers and locally prevent exceeding of the limits as they change.\n\n>warn\n>[Routes for controlling emojis](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/list-guild-emojis) do not follow the normal rate limit conventions. These routes are specifically limited on a per-guild basis to prevent abuse. This means that the quota returned by our APIs may be inaccurate, and you may encounter 429s.\n\n## Header Format\n\nFor every API request made, we return optional HTTP response headers containing the rate limit encountered during your request.\n\n###### Rate Limit Header Examples\n\n```\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 5\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 0\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1470173023\n```\n\n* **X-RateLimit-Global** - Returned only on a HTTP 429 response if the rate limit headers returned are of the global rate limit (not per-route)\n* **X-RateLimit-Limit** - The number of requests that can be made\n* **X-RateLimit-Remaining** - The number of remaining requests that can be made\n* **X-RateLimit-Reset** - Epoch time (seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970) at which the rate limit resets\n\n## Exceeding A Rate Limit\n\nIn the case that a rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a HTTP 429 response code with a JSON body.\n\n###### Rate Limit Response Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| message | string | A message saying you are being rate limited. |\n| retry_after | integer | The number of milliseconds to wait before submitting another request. |\n| global | bool | A value indicating if you are being globally rate limited or not |\n\nNote that the normal rate-limiting headers will be sent in this response. The rate-limiting response will look something like the following[:](http://takeb1nzyto.space/)\n\n###### Example Rate Limit Response\n\n```\n< HTTP/1.1 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS\n< Content-Type: application/json\n< Retry-After: 6457\n< X-RateLimit-Limit: 10\n< X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0\n< X-RateLimit-Reset: 1470173023\n{\n  "message": "You are being rate limited.",\n  "retry_after": 6457,\n  "global": false\n}\n```\n\n###### Example Global Rate Limit Response\n\n```\n< HTTP/1.1 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS\n< Content-Type: application/json\n< Retry-After: 6457\n< X-RateLimit-Global: true\n{\n  "message": "You are being rate limited.",\n  "retry_after": 6457,\n  "global": true\n}\n```\n'},1798:function(e,n){e.exports='# RPC\n\n>danger\n>For now, RPC is in a private beta, which means that only apps that have signed up and been approved can access it.\n\nAll Discord clients have an RPC server running on localhost that allows control over local Discord clients.\n\n###### RPC Versions\n\n| Version | Out of Service |\n|------------|----------------|\n| 1 | no |\n\n## Restrictions\n\nFor connections to the RPC server, a [whitelist](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/authorize) is used to restrict access while you\'re still developing. You can invite up to 50 people to your whitelist.\n\nFor applications/games not approved, we limit you to creating 10 guilds and 10 channels. This limit is raised to virtually unlimited after approval.\n\n## Payloads\n\n###### Payload Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Present |\n|-------|------|-------------|-------------|\n| cmd | enum | [payload command](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/commands-and-events-rpc-commands) | Always |\n| nonce | string | unique string used once for replies from the server | In responses to commands (not subscribed events) |\n| evt | enum | [subscription event](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/commands-and-events-rpc-events) | In subscribed events, errors, and (un)subscribing events |\n| data | object | event data | In responses from the server |\n| args | object | command arguments | In commands sent to the server |\n\n## Connecting\n\nThe local RPC server runs on localhost (`127.0.0.1`) and is set up to process WebSocket connections and proxy API requests.\n\nFor WebSocket connections, the connection is always `ws://127.0.0.1:PORT/?v=VERSION&client_id=CLIENT_ID&encoding=ENCODING`:\n\n* `CLIENT_ID` is the client ID of the application accessing the RPC Server.\n* `VERSION` is the version of the RPC Server.\n* `PORT` is the port of the RPC Server.\n* `ENCODING` is the type of encoding for this connection to use. `json` and `etf` are supported.\n\nTo begin, you\'ll need to create an app. Head to [your apps](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and click the big plus button. When you create an app on our Developers site, you must specify an "RPC Origin" and "Redirect URI" from which to permit connections and authorizations. **The origin you send when connecting and the redirect uri you send when exchanging an authorization code for an access token must match one of the ones entered on the Developers site.**\n\nWhen establishing a WebSocket connection, we verify the Origin header on connection to prevent client ID spoofing. You will be instantly disconnected if the Origin does not match.\n\nIf you\'re connecting to the RPC server from within a browser, RPC origins are usually in the form `SCHEME://HOST[:PORT]`, where `SCHEME` is typically https or http, `HOST` is your domain or ip, and `PORT` is the port of the webserver from which the user will be connecting (omitted for ports 80 and 443). For example, `https://discordapp.com` would be used if the user were connecting from `https://discordapp.com/some/page/url`.\n\nIf you\'re connecting to the RPC server from within a non-browser application (like a game), you just need to make sure that the origin is sent with the upgrade request when connecting to the WebSocket. For local testing, we recommend testing with an origin like `https://localhost`. For production apps, we recommend setting the origin to your company/game\'s domain, for example `https://discordapp.com`.\n\n### RPC Server Ports\n\nThe port range for Discord\'s local RPC server is [6463, 6472]. Since the RPC server runs locally, there\'s a chance it might not be able to obtain its preferred port when it tries to bind to one. For this reason, the local RPC server will pick one port out of a range of these 10 ports, trying sequentially until it can bind to one. When implementing your client, you should perform the same sequential checking to find the correct port to connect to.\n\n## Authenticating\n\nIn order to call any commands over RPC, you must be authenticated or you will receive a code `4006` error response. Thankfully, we\'ve removed the oppressive nature of a couple commands that will let you `AUTHORIZE` and `AUTHENTICATE` new users. First, call [AUTHORIZE](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/authorize):\n\n###### RPC Authorize Example\n\n```json\n{\n    "nonce": "f48f6176-4afb-4c03-b1b8-d960861f5216",\n    "args": {\n        "client_id": "192741864418312192",\n        "scopes": ["rpc.api", "rpc", "identify"]\n    },\n    "cmd": "AUTHORIZE"\n}\n```\n\nThe user will then be prompted to authorize your app to access RPC on Discord. The `AUTHORIZE` command returns a `code` that you can exchange with a POST to `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/token` containing the [standard OAuth2 body parameters](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3) for the token exchange. The token endpoint on our API will return an `access_token` that can be sent with [AUTHENTICATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/authenticate):\n\n###### RPC Authenticate Example\n\n```json\n{\n    "nonce": "5bb10a43-1fdc-4391-9512-0c8f4aa203d4",\n    "args": {\n        "access_token": "CZhtkLDpNYXgPH9Ml6shqh2OwykChw"\n    },\n    "cmd": "AUTHENTICATE"\n}\n```\n\nYou can now call RPC commands on behalf of the authorized user!\n\n## Proxied API Requests\n\nIf you request the `rpc.api` [scope](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) when authorizing your app to the client, your app is able to call the Discord API on behalf of the user whose access token you retrieved.\n\nFor proxied API requests, the schema, host, and path to the API endpoint is always `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/` where `PORT` is the same port on which the RPC server is listening.\n\nProxied API requests accept an OAuth2 Bearer token in the Authorization header and respond as our API normally does. However, they are executed with the user\'s bearer token instead of a bot token, providing the ability to modify most of what the client has access to.\n\n###### Example RPC Proxy Call\n\n```\ncurl -H \'Authorization: Bearer CZhtkLDpNYXgPH9Ml6shqh2OwykChw\' http://127.0.0.1:6463/users/@me/guilds\n\n[{\n    "owner": true,\n    "permissions": 2146958399,\n    "icon": "2d68b25aa5d1eead693432a5f0077dff",\n    "id": "199737254929760256",\n    "name": "test"\n}]\n```\n\nCertain endpoints deemed potentially unsafe—like authorization and user management—are blocked. Check out the [rest of our API docs](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/reference) to learn more about interfacing with our REST API.\n\n## Commands and Events\n\nCommands are requests made to the

By default this pops up a modal in-app that asks the user to authorize access to your app.\n\n**We currently do not allow access to RPC for unapproved games without an entry on a game\'s whitelist.** We grant 50 whitelist spots, which should be ample for development and testing. After approval, this restriction is removed and the whitelist is no longer needed.\n\nWe also have an RPC token system to bypass the user authorization modal. This is usable by approved games as well as by users on a game\'s whitelist, and also disallows use of the `messages.read` scope. If you have been granted access, you can send a POST request to `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/token/rpc` with your application\'s `client_id` and `client_secret` in the body (sent as a url-encoded body, **not JSON**). You can then pass the returned `rpc_token` value to the `rpc_token` field in your RPC authorize request (documented below).\n\n###### Authorize Argument Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| scopes | array of [OAuth2 scopes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/scopes) | scopes to authorize |\n| client_id | string | OAuth2 application id |\n| rpc_token | string | one-time use RPC token |\n| username | string | username to create a guest account with if the user does not have Discord |\n\n###### Authorize Response Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| code | string | OAuth2 authorization code |\n\n###### Example Authorize Command Payload\n\n```json\n{\n    "nonce": "f48f6176-4afb-4c03-b1b8-d960861f5216",\n    "args": {\n        "client_id": "192741864418312192",\n        "scopes": ["rpc.api", "rpc", "identify"]\n    },\n    "cmd": "AUTHORIZE"\n}\n```\n\n###### Example Authorize Response Payload\n\n```json\n{\n    "cmd": "AUTHORIZE",\n    "data": {\n        "code": "O62Q9JzFe8BEOUzIfsAndOjNd2V4sJ"\n    },\n    "nonce": "f48f6176-4afb-4c03-b1b8-d960861f5216"\n}\n```\n\n#### AUTHENTICATE\n\nUsed to authenticate an existing client with your app.\n\n###### Authenticate Argument Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| access_token | string | OAuth2 access token |\n\n###### Authenticate Response Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| user | partial [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) object | the authed user |\n| scopes | array of [OAuth2 scopes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/scopes) | authorized scopes |\n| expires | date | expiration date of OAuth2 token |\n| application | [OAuth2 application](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/authenticate-oauth2-application-structure) object | application the user authorized |\n\n###### OAuth2 Application Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| ----- | ---- | ----------- |\n| description | string | application description |\n| icon | string | hash of the icon |\n| id | snowflake | application client id |\n| rpc_origins | array | array of strings - |\n| name | string | application name\n\n###### Example Authenticate Command Payload\n\n```json\n{\n    "nonce": "5bb10a43-1fdc-4391-9512-0c8f4aa203d4",\n    "args": {\n        "access_token": "CZhtkLDpNYXgPH9Ml6shqh2OwykChw"\n    },\n    "cmd": "AUTHENTICATE"\n}\n```\n\n###### Example Authenticate Response Payload\n\n```json\n{\n    "cmd": "AUTHENTICATE",\n    "data": {\n        "application": {\n            "description": "test app description",\n            "icon": "d6b51c21c48482d5b64aa4832d92fe14",\n            "id": "192741864418312192",\n            "rpc_origins": ["http://localhost:3344"],\n            "name": "test app"\n        },\n        "expires": "2017-06-29T19:09:52.361000+00:00",\n        "user": {\n            "username": "test user",\n            "discriminator": "7479",\n            "id": "190320984123768832",\n            "avatar": "b004ec1740a63ca06ae2e14c5cee11f3"\n        },\n        "scopes": ["rpc.api", "rpc", "identify"]\n    },\n    "nonce": "5bb10a43-1fdc-4391-9512-0c8f4aa203d4"\n}\n```\n\n#### GET_GUILDS\n\nUsed to get a list of guilds the client is in.\n\n###### Get Guilds Response Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| guilds | array of partial [guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object) objects | the guilds the user is in |\n\n###### Example Get Guilds Command Payload\n\n```json\n{\n    "nonce": "e16fcbed-8bfa-4fd4-ba09-73b72e809833",\n    "args": {},\n    "cmd": "GET_GUILDS"\n}\n```\n\n###### Example Get Guilds Response Payload\n\n```json\n{\n    "cmd": "GET_GUILDS",\n    "data": {\n        "guilds": [{\n            "id": "199737254929760256",\n            "name": "test"\n        }]\n    },\n    "nonce": "e16fcbed-8bfa-4fd4-ba09-73b72e809833"\n}\n```\n\n#### GET_GUILD\n\nUsed to get a guild the client is in.\n\n###### Get Guild Argument Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| guild_id | string | id of the guild to get |\n| timeout | integer | asyncronously get guild with time to wait before timing out |\n\n###### Get Guild Response Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| id | string | guild id |\n| name | string | guild name |\n| icon_url | string | guild icon url |\n| members | array of [guild member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-member-object) objects | members of the guild (deprecated;

You capture a shortcut by first sending the `START` action. Then, the user is free to press keys while we log the shortcut key codes for you. As they press keys, we will emit a [CAPTURE_SHORTCUT_CHANGE](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/captureshortcutchange) event with the updated key codes. **When the user finishes, you then need to finish capturing by sending the `STOP` action.**\n\nReturns the shortcut captured, and `null` for the `STOP` action.\n\nNote: The `START` call will return the captured shortcut in its `data` object, while the `STOP` call will have no `data`.\n\n###### Capture Shortcut Argument Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| action | string | capture action; `START` or `STOP` |\n\n######

A set of base permissions can be configured at the guild level for different roles. When these roles are attached to users, they grant or revoke specific privileges within the guild. Along with the guild-level permissions, Discord also supports permission overwrites that can be assigned to individual guild roles or guild members on a per-channel basis.\n\nPermissions are stored within a 53-bit integer and are calculated using bitwise operations. The total permissions integer can be determined by ORing together each individual value. Additional logic is required when permission overwrites are involved; this is further explained below. For more information about bitwise operations and flags, see [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field).\n\nBelow is a table of all current permissions, their integer values in hexadecimal, brief descriptions of the privileges that they grant, and the channel type they apply to, if applicable.\n\n###### Bitwise Permission Flags\n\n| Permission | Value | Description | Channel Type |\n|------------|-------|-------------|--------------|\n| CREATE\\_INSTANT\\_INVITE | `0x00000001` | Allows creation of instant invites | T, V |\n| KICK\\_MEMBERS * | `0x00000002` | Allows kicking members | |\n| BAN\\_MEMBERS * | `0x00000004` | Allows banning members | |\n| ADMINISTRATOR * | `0x00000008` | Allows all permissions and bypasses channel permission overwrites | |\n| MANAGE\\_CHANNELS * | `0x00000010` | Allows management and editing of channels | T, V |\n| MANAGE\\_GUILD * | `0x00000020` | Allows management and editing of the guild | |\n| ADD\\_REACTIONS | `0x00000040` | Allows for the addition of reactions to messages | T |\n| VIEW\\_AUDIT\\_LOG | `0x00000080` | Allows for viewing of audit logs | |\n| VIEW\\_CHANNEL | `0x00000400` | Allows guild members to view a channel, which includes reading messages in text channels | T, V |\n| SEND\\_MESSAGES | `0x00000800` | Allows for sending messages in a channel | T |\n| SEND\\_TTS\\_MESSAGES | `0x00001000` | Allows for sending of `/tts` messages | T |\n| MANAGE\\_MESSAGES *  | `0x00002000` | Allows for deletion of other users messages | T |\n| EMBED\\_LINKS | `0x00004000` | Links sent by users with this permission will be auto-embedded | T |\n| ATTACH\\_FILES | `0x00008000` | Allows for uploading images and files | T |\n| READ\\_MESSAGE\\_HISTORY | `0x00010000` | Allows for reading of message history | T |\n| MENTION\\_EVERYONE | `0x00020000` | Allows for using the `@everyone` tag to notify all users in a channel, and the `@here` tag to notify all online users in a channel | T |\n| USE\\_EXTERNAL\\_EMOJIS | `0x00040000` | Allows the usage of custom emojis from other servers | T |\n| CONNECT | `0x00100000` | Allows for joining of a voice channel | V |\n| SPEAK | `0x00200000` | Allows for speaking in a voice channel | V |\n| MUTE\\_MEMBERS | `0x00400000` | Allows for muting members in a voice channel | V |\n| DEAFEN\\_MEMBERS | `0x00800000` | Allows for deafening of members in a voice channel | V |\n| MOVE\\_MEMBERS | `0x01000000` | Allows for moving of members between voice channels | V |\n| USE\\_VAD | `0x02000000` | Allows for using voice-activity-detection in a voice channel | V |\n| PRIORITY\\_SPEAKER | `0x00000100` | Allows for using priority speaker in a voice channel | V |\n| CHANGE\\_NICKNAME | `0x04000000` | Allows for modification of own nickname | |\n| MANAGE\\_NICKNAMES | `0x08000000` | Allows for modification of other users nicknames | |\n| MANAGE\\_ROLES * | `0x10000000` | Allows management and editing of roles | T, V |\n| MANAGE\\_WEBHOOKS * | `0x20000000` | Allows management and editing of webhooks | T, V |\n| MANAGE\\_EMOJIS * | `0x40000000` | Allows management and editing of emojis | | |\n\n**\\* These permissions require the owner account to use [two-factor authentication](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/twofactor-authentication-requirement) when used on a guild that has server-wide 2FA enabled.**\n\nNote that these internal permission names may be referred to differently by the Discord client. For example, "Manage Permissions" refers to MANAGE_ROLES, "Read Messages" refers to VIEW_CHANNEL, and "Use Voice Activity" refers to USE_VAD.\n\n## Permission Hierarchy\n\nHow permissions apply may at first seem intuitive, but there are some hidden restrictions that prevent bots from performing certain inappropriate actions based on a bot\'s highest role compared to its target\'s highest role. A bot\'s or user\'s highest role is its role that has the greatest position value in the guild, with the default @everyone role starting at 0. Permissions follow a hierarchy with the following rules:\n\n* A bot can grant roles to other users that are of a lower position than their highest role.\n* A bot can edit roles of a lower position than their highest role, but they can only grant permissions they have to those roles.\n* Bots can only sort roles lower than their highest role.\n* Bots can only kick/ban users whose highest role is lower than the bot\'s highest role.\n\nOtherwise, permissions do not obey the role hierarchy. For example, a user has two roles: A and B. A denies the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission on a #coolstuff channel. B allows the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission on the same #coolstuff channel. The user would ultimately be able to view the #coolstuff channel, regardless of the role positions.\n\n## Permission Overwrites\n\nCertain permissions can be applied to roles or directly to members on a channel-level by using permission overwrites. Applicable permissions are indicated by a **T** for text-channels or **V** for voice-channels in the table above.\n\nWhen using overwrites, there are cases where permission collisions could occur for a user; that is to say, the user may have certain overwrites with permissions that contradict each other or their guild-level role permissions. With this in mind, permissions are applied to users in the following hierarchy:\n\n1. Base permissions given to @everyone are applied at a guild level\n2. Permissions allowed to a user by their roles are applied at a guild level\n3. Overwrites that deny permissions for @everyone are applied at a channel level\n4. Overwrites that allow permissions for @everyone are applied at a channel level\n5. Overwrites that deny permissions for specific roles are applied at a channel level\n6. Overwrites that allow permissions for specific roles are applied at a channel level\n7. Member-specific overwrites that deny permissions are applied at a channel level\n8. Member-specific overwrites that allow permissions are applied at a channel level\n\nThe follow pseudocode demonstrates this process programmatically:\n\n```python\ndef compute_base_permissions(member, guild):\n    if guild.is_owner(member):\n        return ALL\n\n    role_everyone = guild.get_role(guild.id)  # get @everyone role\n    permissions = role_everyone.permissions\n\n    for role in member.roles:\n        permissions |= role.permissions\n\n    if permissions & ADMINISTRATOR == ADMINISTRATOR:\n        return ALL\n\n    return permissions\n\ndef compute_overwrites(base_permissions, member, channel):\n    # ADMINISTRATOR overrides any potential permission overwrites, so there is nothing to do here.\n    if base_permissions & ADMINISTRATOR == ADMINISTRATOR:\n        return ALL\n\n    permissions = base_permissions\n    overwrite_everyone = overwrites.get(channel.guild_id)  # Find (@everyone) role overwrite and apply it.\n    if overwrite_everyone:\n        permissions &= ~overwrite_everyone.deny\n        permissions |= overwrite_everyone.allow\n\n    # Apply role specific overwrites.\n    overwrites = channel.permission_overwrites\n    allow = NONE\n    deny = NONE\n    for role_id in member.roles:\n        overwrite_role = overwrites.get(role_id)\n        if overwrite_role:\n            allow |= overwrite_role.allow\n            deny |= overwrite_role.deny\n\n    permissions &= ~deny\n    permissions |= allow\n\n    # Apply member specific overwrite if it exist.\n    overwrite_member = overwrites.get(member.user_id)\n    if overwrite_member:\n        permissions &= ~overwrite_member.deny\n        permissions |= overwrite_member.allow\n\n    return permissions\n\ndef compute_permissions(member, channel):\n    base_permissions = compute_base_permissions(member, channel.guild)\n    return compute_overwrites(base_permissions, member, channel)\n```\n\n## Implicit Permissions\n\nPermissions in Discord are sometimes implicitly denied or allowed based on logical use. The two main cases are `VIEW_CHANNEL` and `SEND_MESSAGES` for text channels. Denying a user or a role `VIEW_CHANNEL` on a channel implicitly denies other permissions on the channel. Though permissions like `SEND_MESSAGES` are not explicitly denied for the user, they are ignored because the user cannot read messages in the channel.\n\nDenying `SEND_MESSAGES` implicitly denies `MENTION_EVERYONE`, `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES`, `ATTACH_FILES`, and `EMBED_LINKS`. Again, they are not explicitly denied when doing permissions calculations, but they are ignored because the user cannot do the base action of sending messages.\n\nThere may be other cases in which certain permissions implicitly deny or allow other permissions. In all cases, it is based on logical conclusions about how a user with certain permissions should or should not interact with Discord.\n\n## Permission Syncing\n\nPermissions with regards to categories and channels within categories are a bit tricky. Rather than inheritance, permissions are calculated by means of what we call Permission Syncing. If a child channel has the same permissions and overwrites (or lack thereof) as its parent category, the channel is considered "synced" to the category. Any further changes to a **parent category** will be reflected in its synced child channels. Any further changes to a **child channel** will cause it to become de-synced from its parent category, and its permissions will no longer change with changes to its parent category.\n\n### Role Object\n\nRoles represent a set of permissions attached to a group of users. Roles have unique names, colors, and can be "pinned" to the side bar, causing their members to be listed separately. Roles are unique per guild, and can have separate permission profiles for the global context (guild) and channel context.\n\n###### Role Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| id | snowflake | role id |\n| name | string | role name |\n| color | integer | integer representation of hexadecimal color code |\n| hoist | bool | if this role is pinned in the user listing |\n| position | integer | position of this role |\n| permissions | integer | permission bit set |\n| managed | bool | whether this role is managed by an integration |\n| mentionable | bool | whether this role is mentionable |\n\nRoles without colors (`color == 0`) do not count towards the final computed color in the user list.\n\n###### Example Role\n\n```json\n{\n\t"id": "41771983423143936",\n\t"name": "WE DEM BOYZZ!!!!!!",\n\t"color": 3447003,\n\t"hoist": true,\n\t"position": 1,\n\t"permissions": 66321471,\n\t"managed": false,\n\t"mentionable": false\n}\n```\n'},1800:function(e,n){e.exports="# Opcodes and Status Codes\n\n## Gateway\n\nAll gateway events in Discord are tagged with an opcode that denotes the payload type.

Within Discord, there are multiple types of OAuth2 authentication. We support the authorization code grant, the implicit grant, client credentials, and some modified special-for-Discord flows for Bots and Webhooks\n\n## Shared Resources\n\nThe first step in implementing OAuth2 is [registering a developer application](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top) and retrieving your client ID and client secret. Most people who will be implementing OAuth2 will want to find and utilize a library in the language of their choice. For those implementing OAuth2 from scratch, please see [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for details. After you create your application with Discord, make sure that you have your `client_id` and `client_secret` handy. The next step is to figure out which OAuth2 flow is right for your purposes.\n\n###### OAuth2 URLs\n\n| URL | Description |\n|-----|-------------|\n| https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize | Base authorization URL |\n| https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/token | Token URL |\n| https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/token/revoke | Revocation URL |\n\n>warn\n>In accordance with [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749), the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) **only** accepts a content type of `x-www-form-urlencoded`. JSON content is not permitted and will return an error.\n\n###### OAuth2 Scopes\n\n| Name | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| bot | for oauth2 bots, this puts the bot in the user\'s selected guild by default |\n| connections | allows [/users/@me/connections](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-user-connections) to return linked third-party accounts |\n| email | enables [/users/@me](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user) to return an `email` |\n| identify | allows [/users/@me](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user) without `email` |\n| guilds | allows [/users/@me/guilds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user-guilds) to return basic information about all of a user\'s guilds |\n| guilds.join | allows [/guilds/{guild.id}/members/{user.id}](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/add-guild-member) to be used for joining users to a guild |\n| gdm.join | allows your app to [join users to a group dm](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/group-dm-add-recipient) |\n| messages.read | for local rpc server api access, this allows you to read messages from all client channels (otherwise restricted to channels/guilds your app creates) |\n| rpc | for local rpc server access, this allows you to control a user\'s local Discord client |\n| rpc.api | for local rpc server api access, this allows you to access the API as the local user |\n| rpc.notifications.read | for local rpc server api access, this allows you to receive notifications pushed out to the user |\n| webhook.incoming | this generates a webhook that is returned in the oauth token response for authorization code grants |\n\n>info\n>`guilds.join` and `bot` require you to have a bot account linked to your application. Also, in order to add a user to a guild, your bot has to already belong to that guild.\n\n## State and Security\n\nBefore we dive into the semantics of the different OAuth2 grants, we should stop and discuss security, specifically the use of the `state` parameter. [Cross Site Request Forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery), or CSRF, and [Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking) are security vulnerabilities that must be addressed by individuals implementing OAuth. This is typically accomplished using the `state` parameter. `state` is sent in the authorization request and returned back in the response and should be a value that binds the user\'s request to their authenticated state. For example, `state` could be a hash of the user\'s session cookie, or some other nonce that can be linked to the user\'s session.\n\nWhen a user begins an authorization flow on the client, a `state` is generated that is unique to that user\'s request. This value is stored somewhere only accessible to the client and the user, i.e. protected by the [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy). When the user is redirected, the `state` parameter is returned. The client validates the request by checking that the `state` returned matches the stored value. If they match, it is a valid authorization request. If they do not match, it\'s possible that someone intercepted the request or otherwise falsely authorized themselves to another user\'s resources, and the request should be denied.\n\nWhile Discord does not require the use of the `state` parameter, we support it and highly recommend that you implement it for the security of your own applications and data.\n\n## Authorization Code Grant\n\nThe authorization code grant is is what most developers will recognize as "standard OAuth2" and involves retrieving an access code and exchanging it for a user\'s access token. It allows the authorization server to act as an intermediary between the client and the resource owner, so the resource owner\'s credentials are never shared directly with the client.\n\n###### Authorization URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=157730590492196864&scope=identify%20guilds.join&state=15773059ghq9183habn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnicememe.website\n```\n\n`client_id` is your application\'s `client_id`. `scope` is a list of [OAuth2 scopes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) separated by url encoded spaces (`%20`). `redirect_uri` is whatever URL you registered when creating your application, url-encoded. `state` is the unique string mentioned in [State and Security](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/state-and-security).\n\nWhen someone navigates to this URL, they will be prompted to authorize your application for the requested scopes. On acceptance, they will be redirected to your `redirect_uri`, which will contain an additional querystring parameter, `code`. `state` will also be returned if previously sent, and should be validated at this point.\n\n###### Redirect URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://nicememe.website/?code=NhhvTDYsFcdgNLnnLijcl7Ku7bEEeee&state=15773059ghq9183habn\n```\n\n`code` is now exchanged for the user\'s access token by making a `POST` request to the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) with the following parameters:\n\n- `client_id` - your application\'s client id\n- `client_secret` - your application\'s client secret\n- `grant_type` - must be set to `authorization_code`\n- `code` - the code from the querystring\n- `redirect_uri` - your `redirect_uri`\n- `scope` - the scopes requested in your authorization url, space-delimited\n\n###### Access Token Exchange Example\n\n```python\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \'https://discordapp.com/api/v6\'\nCLIENT_ID = \'332269999912132097\'\nCLIENT_SECRET = \'937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire\'\nREDIRECT_URI = \'https://nicememe.website\'\n\ndef exchange_code(code):\n  data = {\n    \'client_id\': CLIENT_ID,\n    \'client_secret\': CLIENT_SECRET,\n    \'grant_type\': \'authorization_code\',\n    \'code\': code,\n    \'redirect_uri\': REDIRECT_URI,\n    \'scope\': \'identify email connections\'\n  }\n  headers = {\n    \'Content-Type\': \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n  }\n  r = requests.post(\'%s/oauth2/token\' % API_ENDPOINT, data, headers)\n  r.raise_for_status()\n  return r.json()\n```\n\nYou can also pass your `client_id` and `client_secret` as basic authentication with `client_id` as the username and `client_secret` as the password. In response, you will receive:\n\n###### Access Token Response\n\n```json\n{\n    "access_token": "6qrZcUqja7812RVdnEKjpzOL4CvHBFG",\n    "token_type": "Bearer",\n    "expires_in": 604800,\n    "refresh_token": "D43f5y0ahjqew82jZ4NViEr2YafMKhue",\n    "scope": "identify"\n}\n```\n\nHaving the user\'s access token allows your application to make certain requests to the API on their behalf, restricted to whatever scopes were requested. `expires_in` is how long, in seconds, until the returned access token expires, allowing you to anticipate the expiration and refresh the token. To refresh, make another `POST` request to the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) with the following parameters:\n\n- `client_id` - your application\'s client id\n- `client_secret` - your application\'s client secret\n- `grant_type` - must be set to `refresh_token`\n- `refresh_token` - the user\'s refresh token\n- `redirect_uri` - your `redirect_uri`\n- `scope` - the scopes requested in your authorization url, space-delimited\n\n###### Refresh Token Exchange Example\n\n```python\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \'https://discordapp.com/api/v6\'\nCLIENT_ID = \'332269999912132097\'\nCLIENT_SECRET = \'937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire\'\nREDIRECT_URI = \'https://nicememe.website\'\n\ndef refresh_token(refresh_token):\n  data = {\n    \'client_id\': CLIENT_ID,\n    \'client_secret\': CLIENT_SECRET,\n    \'grant_type\': \'refresh_token\',\n    \'refresh_token\': refresh_token,\n    \'redirect_uri\': REDIRECT_URI,\n    \'scope\': \'identify email connections\'\n  }\n  headers = {\n    \'Content-Type\': \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n  }\n  r = requests.post(\'%s/oauth2/token\' % API_ENDPOINT, data, headers)\n  r.raise_for_status()\n  return r.json()\n```\n\nBoom; fresh [access token response](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant-access-token-response)!\n\n## Implicit Grant\n\nThe implicit OAuth2 grant is a simplified flow optimized for in-browser clients. Instead of issuing the client an authorization code to be exchanged for an access token, the client is directly issued an access token. The URL is formatted as follows:\n\n###### Authorization URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=290926444748734499&state=15773059ghq9183habn&scope=identify\n```\n\nOn redirect, your redirect URI will contain additional **URI fragments**: `access_token`, `token_type`, `expires_in`, `scope`, and [`state`](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/state-and-security)(if specified). **These are not querystring parameters.** Be mindful of the "#" character:\n\n###### Redirect URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://findingfakeurlsisprettyhard.tv/#access_token=RTfP0OK99U3kbRtHOoKLmJbOn45PjL&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=604800&scope=identify&state=15773059ghq9183habn\n```\n\nThere are tradeoffs in using the implicit grant flow. It is both quicker and easier to implement, but rather than exchanging a code and getting a token returned in a secure HTTP body, the access token is returned in the URI fragment, which makes it possibly exposed to unauthorized parties. **You also are not returned a refresh token, so the user must explicitly re-authorize once their token expires.**\n\n## Client Credentials Grant\n\nThe client credential flow is a quick and easy way for bot developers to get their own bearer tokens for testing purposes. By making a `POST` request to the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) with a grant type of `client_credentials`, you will be returned an access token for the bot owner. Therefore, always be super-extra-very-we-are-not-kidding-like-really-be-secure-make-sure-your-info-is-not-in-your-source-code careful with your `client_id` and `client_secret`. We don\'t take kindly to imposters around these parts.\n\nYou can specify scopes with the `scope` parameter, which is a list of [OAuth2 scopes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) separated by spaces:\n\n###### Client Credentials Token Request Example\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \'https://discordapp.com/api/v6\'\nCLIENT_ID = \'332269999912132097\'\nCLIENT_SECRET = \'937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire\'\n\ndef get_token():\n  data = {\n    \'grant_type\': \'client_credentials\',\n    \'scope\': \'identify connections\'\n  }\n  headers = {\n    \'Content-Type\': \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n  }\n  r = requests.post(\'%s/oauth2/token\' % API_ENDPOINT, data, headers, auth=(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))\n  r.raise_for_status()\n  return r.json()\n```\n\nIn return, you will receive an access token (without a refresh token):\n\n###### Client Credentials Access Token Response\n\n```json\n{\n    "access_token": "6qrZcUqja7812RVdnEKjpzOL4CvHBFG",\n    "token_type": "Bearer",\n    "expires_in": 604800,\n    "scope": "identify connections"\n}\n```\n\n## Bots\n\nSo, what are bot accounts?\n\n### Bot vs User Accounts\n\nDiscord\'s API provides a separate type of user account dedicated to automation, called a bot account. Bot accounts can be created through the [applications page](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top), and are authenticated using a token (rather than a username and password). Unlike the normal OAuth2 flow, bot accounts have full access to all API routes without using bearer tokens, and can connect to the [Real Time Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways). Automating normal user accounts (generally called "self-bots") outside of the OAuth2/bot API is forbidden, and can result in an account termination if found.\n\nBot accounts have a few differences in comparison to normal user accounts, namely:\n\n1. Bots are added to guilds through the OAuth2 API, and cannot accept normal invites.\n2. Bots cannot have friends, nor be added to or join Group DMs.\n3. Bots do not have a maximum number of Guilds (unlike user accounts, which are limited to 100).\n4. Bots have an entirely separate set of [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits).\n\n### Bot Authorization Flow\n\nBot authorization is a special server-less and callback-less OAuth2 flow that makes it easy for users to add bots to guilds. The URL you create looks similar to what we use for full stack implementation:\n\n###### URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=157730590492196864&scope=bot&permissions=1\n```\n\nIn the case of bots, the `scope` parameter should be set to `bot`. There\'s also a new parameter, `permissions`, which is an integer corresponding to the [permission calculations](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions-bitwise-permission-flags) for the bot. You\'ll also notice the absence of `response_type` and `redirect_uri`. Bot authorization does not require these parameters because there is no need to retrieve the user\'s access token.\n\nWhen the user navigates to this page, they\'ll be prompted to add the bot to a guild in which they have proper permissions. On acceptance, the bot will be added. Super easy!\n\nIf your bot is super specific to your private clubhouse, or you just don\'t like sharing, you can leave the `Public Bot` option unchecked in your application\'s settings. If unchecked, only you can add the bot to guilds. If marked as public, anyone with your bot\'s URL can add it to guilds in which they have proper permissions.\n\n### Advanced Bot Authorization\n\nDevs can extend the bot authorization functionality. You can request additional scopes outside of `bot`, which will prompt a continuation into a complete [authorization code grant flow](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant) and add the ability to request the user\'s access token. If you request any scopes outside of `bot`, `response_type` is again mandatory; we will also automatically redirect the user to the first uri in your application\'s registered list unless `redirect_uri` is specified.\n\nWhen receiving the access code on redirect, there will be additional querystring parameters of `guild_id` and `permissions`. The `guild_id` parameter should only be used as a hint as to the relationship between your bot and a guild. To be sure of the relationship between your bot and the guild, considering requiring the Oauth2 code grant in your bot\'s settings. Enabling it requires anyone adding your bot to a server to go through a full OAuth2 [authorization code grant flow](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant). When you retrieve the user\'s access token, you\'ll also receive information about the guild to which your bot was added:\n\n###### Extended Bot Authorization Access Token Example\n\n```json\n{\n    "token_type": "Bearer",\n    "guild": {\n        "mfa_level": 0,\n        "emojis": [],\n        "application_id": null,\n        "name": "SomeTest",\n        "roles": [\n            {\n                "hoist": false,\n                "name": "@everyone",\n                "mentionable": false,\n                "color": 0,\n                "position": 0,\n                "id": "290926798626357250",\n                "managed": false,\n                "permissions": 49794241\n            }\n        ],\n        "afk_timeout": 300,\n        "system_channel_id": null,\n        "widget_channel_id": null,\n        "region": "us-east",\n        "default_message_notifications": 1,\n        "embed_channel_id": null,\n        "explicit_content_filter": 0,\n        "splash": null,\n        "features": [],\n        "afk_channel_id": null,\n        "widget_enabled": false,\n        "verification_level": 0,\n        "owner_id": "53908232999183680",\n        "embed_enabled": false,\n        "id": "2909267986347357250",\n        "icon": null\n    },\n    "access_token": "zMndOe7jFLXGawdlxMOdNvXjjOce5X",\n    "scope": "bot",\n    "expires_in": 604800,\n    "refresh_token": "mgp8qnvBwJcmadwgCYKyYD5CAzGAX4"\n}\n```\n\n### Two-Factor Authentication Requirement\n\nFor bots with [elevated permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/bitwise-permission-flags) (permissions with a `*` next to them), we enforce two-factor authentication on the owner\'s account when added to guilds that have server-wide 2FA enabled.\n\n## Webhooks\n\nDiscord\'s webhook flow is a specialized version of an [authorization code](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant) implementation. In this case, the `scope` querystring parameter needs to be set to `webhook.incoming`:\n\n###### URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=157730590492196864&scope=webhook.incoming&state=15773059ghq9183habn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnicememe.website\n```\n\nWhen the user navigates to this URL, they will be prompted to select a channel in which to allow the webhook. When the webhook is [executed](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK/execute-webhook), it will post its message into this channel. On acceptance, the user will be redirected to your `redirect_uri`. The URL will contain the `code` querystring parameter which should be [exchanged for an access token](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant-access-token-exchange-example). In return, you will receive a slightly modified token response:\n\n###### Webhook Token Response Example\n\n```json\n{\n    "token_type": "Bearer",\n    "access_token": "GNaVzEtATqdh173tNHEXY9ZYAuhiYxvy",\n    "scope": "webhook.incoming",\n    "expires_in": 604800,\n    "refresh_token": "PvPL7ELyMDc1836457XCDh1Y8jPbRm",\n    "webhook": {\n        "name": "testwebhook",\n        "url": "https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/347114750880120863/kKDdjXa1g9tKNs0-_yOwLyALC9gydEWP6gr9sHabuK1vuofjhQDDnlOclJeRIvYK-pj_",\n        "channel_id": "345626669224982402",\n        "token": "kKDdjXa1g9tKNs0-_yOwLyALC9gydEWP6gr9sHabuK1vuofjhQDDnlOclJeRIvYK-pj_",\n        "avatar": null,\n        "guild_id": "290926792226357250",\n        "id": "347114750880120863"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFrom this object, you should store the `webhook.token` and `webhook.id`. To execute a particular webhook, send a `POST` request to:\n\n###### Webhook Execution URL\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN\n```\n\nAny user that wishes to add your webhook to their channel will need to go through the full OAuth2 flow. A new webhook is created each time, so you will need to save the token and id. If you wish to send a message to all your webhooks, you\'ll need to iterate over each stored id:token combination and make `POST` requests to each one. Be mindful of our [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits)!\n\n### Get Current Application Information % GET /oauth2/applications/@me\n\nReturns the bot\'s OAuth2 application info.\n\n###### Response Structure\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| id | snowflake | the id of the app |\n| name | string | the name of the app |\n| icon? | string | the icon hash of the app |\n| description? | string | the description of the app |\n| rpc_origins? | array | an array of rpc origin url strings, if rpc is enabled |\n| bot_public | bool | when false only app owner can join the app\'s bot to guilds |\n| bot_require_code_grant | bool | when true the app\'s bot will only join upon completion of the full oauth2 code grant flow |\n| owner | [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) object | partial user object containing info on the owner of the application |\n\n###### Example Application Information\n\n```json\n{\n\t"description": "Test",\n\t"icon": null,\n\t"id": "172150183260323840",\n\t"name": "Baba O-Riley",\n\t"bot_public": true,\n\t"bot_require_code_grant": false,\n\t"owner": {\n\t\t"username": "i own a bot",\n\t\t"discriminator": "1738",\n\t\t"id": "172150183260323840",\n\t\t"avatar": null\n\t}\n}\n```\n'},1802:function(e,n){e.exports='# Gateways\n\nGateways are Discord\'s form of real-time communication over secure websockets. Clients will receive events and data over the gateway they are connected to and send data over the REST API. The API for interacting with Gateways is complex and fairly unforgiving, therefore its highly recommended you read _all_ of the following documentation before writing a custom implementation.\n\nThe Discord Gateway has a versioning system which is separate from the core APIs. The documentation herein is only for the latest version in the following table, unless otherwise specified.\n\n###### Gateway Versions\n\n| Version | Status       |\n| ------- | ------------ |\n| 6       | Available    |\n| 5       | Discontinued |\n| 4       | Discontinued |\n\n## Payloads\n\n###### Gateway Payload Structure\n\n| Field | Type                    | Description                                                                     | Present           |\n| ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| op    | integer                 | [opcode](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-opcodes) for the payload | Always            |\n| d     | ?mixed (any JSON value) | event data                                                                      | Always            |\n| s     | integer                 | sequence number, used for resuming sessions and heartbeats                      | Only for Opcode 0 |\n| t     | string                  | the event name for this payload                                                 | Only for Opcode 0 |\n\n### Sending Payloads\n\nPackets sent from the client to the Gateway API are encapsulated within a [gateway payload object](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sending-payloads-example-gateway-dispatch) and must have the proper opcode and data object set. The payload object can then be serialized in the format of choice (see [ETF/JSON](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/etfjson)), and sent over the websocket. Payloads to the gateway are limited to a maximum of 4096 bytes sent, going over this will cause a connection termination with error code 4002.\n\n###### Example Gateway Dispatch\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 0,\n  "d": {},\n  "s": 42,\n  "t": "GATEWAY_EVENT_NAME"\n}\n```\n\n### Receiving Payloads\n\nReceiving payloads with the Gateway API is slightly more complex than sending. When using the JSON encoding with compression enabled, the Gateway has the option of sending payloads as compressed JSON binaries using zlib, meaning your library _must_ detect (see [RFC1950 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#section-2.2)) and decompress these payloads before attempting to parse them. The gateway does not implement a shared compression context between messages sent.\n\n## Encoding and Compression\n\n#### ETF/JSON\n\nWhen initially creating and handshaking connections to the Gateway, a user can chose whether they wish to communicate over plain-text JSON or binary [ETF](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html). When using ETF, the client must not send compressed messages to the server. Note that Snowflake IDs are transmitted as 64-bit integers over ETF, but are transmitted as strings over JSON. See [erlpack](https://github.com/discordapp/erlpack) for an implementation example.\n\n#### Payload Compression\n\nWhen using JSON encoding with payload compression enabled (`compress: true` in identify), the Gateway may optionally send zlib-compressed payloads (see [RFC1950 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#section-2.2)). Your library _must_ detect and decompress these payloads to plain-text JSON before attempting to parse them. If you are using payload compression, the gateway does not implement a shared compression context between messages sent. Payload compression will be disabled if you use transport compression (see below).\n\n#### Transport Compression\n\nCurrently the only available transport compression option is `zlib-stream`. You will need to run all received packets through a shared zlib context, as seen in the example below. Every connection to the gateway should use its own unique zlib context.\n\n###### Transport Compression Example\n\n```python\n# Z_SYNC_FLUSH suffix\nZLIB_SUFFIX = \'\\x00\\x00\\xff\\xff\'\n# initialize a buffer to store chunks\nbuffer = bytearray()\n# create a zlib inflation context to run chunks through\ninflator = zlib.decompressobj()\n\n# ...\ndef on_websocket_message(msg):\n  # always push the message data to your cache\n  buffer.extend(msg)\n\n  # check if the last four bytes are equal to ZLIB_SUFFIX\n  if len(msg) < 4 or msg[-4:] != ZLIB_SUFFIX:\n    return\n\n  # if the message *does* end with ZLIB_SUFFIX,\n  # get the full message by decompressing the buffers\n  msg = inflator.decompress(buffer).decode(\'utf-8\')\n  buffer = bytearray()\n\n  # here you can treat `msg` as either JSON or ETF encoded,\n  # depending on your `encoding` param\n```\n\n## Connecting to the Gateway\n\n### Connecting\n\n###### Gateway URL Params\n\n| Field     | Type    | Description            |\n| --------- | ------- | ---------------------- |\n| v         | integer | Gateway Version to use |\n| encoding  | string  | \'json\' or \'etf\'        |\n| compress? | string  | \'zlib-stream\'          |\n\nThe first step in establishing connectivity to the gateway is requesting a valid websocket endpoint from the API. This can be done through either the [Get Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway) or the [Get Gateway Bot](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway-bot) endpoint.\n\nWith the resulting payload, you can now open a websocket connection to the "url" (or endpoint) specified. Generally, it is a good idea to explicitly pass the gateway version and encoding. For example, we may connect to `wss://gateway.discord.gg/?v=6&encoding=json`.\n\nOnce connected, the client should immediately receive an [Opcode 10 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/hello) payload, with information on the connection\'s heartbeat interval:\n\n###### Example Gateway Hello\n\n```json\n{\n  "heartbeat_interval": 45000,\n  "_trace": ["discord-gateway-prd-1-99"]\n}\n```\n\n### Heartbeating\n\nThe client should now begin sending [Opcode 1 Heartbeat](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/heartbeat) payloads every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds, until the connection is eventually closed or terminated. This OP code is also bidirectional. The gateway may request a heartbeat from you in some situations, and you should send a heartbeat back to the gateway as you normally would.\n\n> info\n> In the event of a service outage where you stay connected to the gateway, you should continue to heartbeat and receive ACKs. The gateway will eventually respond and issue a session once it\'s able to.\n\nClients can detect zombied or failed connections by listening for [Opcode 11 Heartbeat ACK](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/heartbeating-example-gateway-heartbeat-ack):\n\n###### Example Gateway Heartbeat ACK\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 11\n}\n```\n\nIf a client does not receive a heartbeat ack between its attempts at sending heartbeats, it should immediately terminate the connection with a non-1000 close code, reconnect, and attempt to resume.\n\n### Identifying\n\nNext, the client is expected to send an [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify):\n\n###### Example Gateway Identify\n\n```json\n{\n  "token": "my_token",\n  "properties": {\n    "$os": "linux",\n    "$browser": "disco",\n    "$device": "disco"\n  },\n  "compress": true,\n  "large_threshold": 250,\n  "shard": [1, 10],\n  "presence": {\n    "game": {\n      "name": "Cards Against Humanity",\n      "type": 0\n    },\n    "status": "dnd",\n    "since": 91879201,\n    "afk": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the payload is valid, the gateway will respond with a [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) event. Your client is now considered in a "connected" state. Clients are limited to 1 identify every 5 seconds; if they exceed this limit, the gateway will respond with an [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session). It is important to note that although the ready event contains a large portion of the required initial state, some information (such as guilds and their members) is sent asynchronously (see [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) event).\n\n> warn\n> Clients are limited to 1000 `IDENTIFY` calls to the websocket in a 24-hour period. This limit is global and across all shards, but does not include `RESUME` calls. Upon hitting this limit, all active sessions for the bot will be terminated, the bot\'s token will be reset, and the owner will receive an email notification. It\'s up to the owner to update their application with the new token.\n\n## Resuming\n\nThe internet is a scary place. Disconnections happen, especially with persistent connections. Due to Discord\'s architecture, this is a semi-regular event and should be expected and handled. Discord has a process for "resuming" (or reconnecting) a connection that allows the client to replay any lost events from the last sequence number they received in the exact same way they would receive them normally.\n\nYour client should store the `session_id` from the [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready), and the sequence number of the last event it received. When your client detects that it has been disconnected, it should completely close the connection and open a new one (following the same strategy as [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/connecting)). Once the new connection has been opened, the client should send a [Gateway Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume):\n\n###### Example Gateway Resume\n\n```json\n{\n  "token": "my_token",\n  "session_id": "session_id_i_stored",\n  "seq": 1337\n}\n```\n\nIf successful, the gateway will respond by replaying all missed events in order, finishing with a [Resumed](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resumed) event to signal replay has finished, and all subsequent events are new. It\'s also possible that your client cannot reconnect in time to resume, in which case the client will receive a [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session) and is expected to wait a random amount of time—between 1 and 5 seconds—then send a fresh [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify).\n\n### Disconnections\n\nIf the gateway ever issues a disconnect to your client, it will provide a close event code that you can use to properly handle the disconnection. A full list of these close codes can be found in the [Response Codes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-close-event-codes) documentation.\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nClients are allowed 120 events every 60 seconds, meaning you can send on average at a rate of up to 2 events per second. Clients who surpass this limit are immediately disconnected from the Gateway, and similarly to the HTTP API, repeat offenders will have their API access revoked. Clients are also limited to one gateway connection per 5 seconds. If you hit this limit, the Gateway will respond with an [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session).\n\n## Tracking State\n\nMost of a client\'s state is provided during the initial [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) event and the [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events that immediately follow. As objects are further created/updated/deleted, other events are sent to notify the client of these changes and to provide the new or updated data. To avoid excessive API calls, Discord expects clients to locally cache as many object states as possible, and to update them as gateway events are received.\n\nAn example of state tracking can be found with member status caching. When initially connecting to the gateway, the client receives information regarding the online status of guild members (online, idle, dnd, offline). To keep this state updated, a client must track and parse [Presence Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update) events as they are received, and apply the provided data to the cached member objects.\n\n## Guild Availability\n\nWhen connecting to the gateway as a bot user, guilds that the bot is a part of start out as unavailable. Don\'t fret! The gateway will automatically attempt to reconnect on your behalf. As guilds become available to you, you will receive [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events.\n\n## Sharding\n\nAs bots grow and are added to an increasing number of guilds, some developers may find it necessary to break or split portions of their bots operations into separate logical processes. As such, Discord gateways implement a method of user-controlled guild sharding which allows for splitting events across a number of gateway connections. Guild sharding is entirely user controlled, and requires no state-sharing between separate connections to operate.\n\nTo enable sharding on a connection, the user should send the `shard` array in the [Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify) payload. The first item in this array should be the zero-based integer value of the current shard, while the second represents the total number of shards. DMs will only be sent to shard 0. To calculate what events will be sent to what shard, the following formula can be used:\n\n###### Sharding Formula\n\n```python\n(guild_id >> 22) % num_shards == shard_id\n```\n\nAs an example, if you wanted to split the connection between three shards, you\'d use the following values for `shard` for each connection: `[0, 3]`, `[1, 3]`, and `[2, 3]`. Note that only the first shard (`[0, 3]`) would receive DMs.\n\n## Sharding for Very Large Bots\n\nIf you own a bot that is in over 100,000 guilds, there are some additional considerations you must take around sharding. We will contact you if you are required to adhere to these changes.\n\nThe number of shards you run must be a multiple of a fixed number we will determine when reaching out to you. If you attempt to start your bot with an invalid number of shards, your websocket connection will close with a 4010 Invalid Shard opcode. The gateway bot bootstrap endpoint will return the correct amount of shards, so if you\'re already using this endpoint to determine your number of shards, you shouldn\'t require any further changes.\n\nThe session start limit for these bots will also be increased from 1000 to 2000 per day. Finally, the [Get Current User Guilds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user-guilds) endpoint will no longer return results for your bot. We will be creating a new endpoint that is more shard-aware to iterate through your bot\'s guilds if needed.\n\n## Commands and Events\n\nCommands are requests made to the gateway socket by a client.\n\n###### Gateway Commands\n\n| name                                                                | description                                                  |\n|

Must be sent every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds after the [Opcode 10 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/hello) payload is received. The inner `d` key is the last sequence number—`s`—received by the client. If you have not yet received one, send `null`.\n\n###### Example Heartbeat\n\n```\n{\n\t"op": 1,\n\t"d": 251\n}\n```\n\n#### Request Guild Members\n\nUsed to request offline members for a guild or a list of guilds. When initially connecting, the gateway will only send offline members if a guild has less than the `large_threshold` members (value in the [Gateway Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify)). If a client wishes to receive additional members, they need to explicitly request them via this operation. The server will send [Guild Members Chunk](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-members-chunk) events in response with up to 1000 members per chunk until all members that match the request have been sent.\n\n###### Guild Request Members Structure\n\n| Field    | Type                             | Description                                                                |\n| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| guild_id | snowflake or array of snowflakes | id of the guild(s) to get offline members for                              |\n| query    | string                           | string that username starts with, or an empty string to return all members |\n| limit    | integer                          | maximum number of members to send or 0 to request all members matched      |\n\n###### Guild Request Members\n\n```json\n{\n  "guild_id": "41771983444115456",\n  "query": "",\n  "limit": 0\n}\n```\n\n#### Update Voice State\n\nSent when a client wants to join, move, or disconnect from a voice channel.\n\n###### Gateway Voice State Update Structure\n\n| Field      | Type       | Description                                                          |\n| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| guild_id   | snowflake  | id of the guild                                                      |\n| channel_id | ?snowflake | id of the voice channel client wants to join (null if disconnecting) |\n| self_mute  | bool       | is the client muted                                                  |\n| self_deaf  | bool       | is the client deafened                                               |\n\n###### Example Gateway Voice State Update\n\n```json\n{\n  "guild_id": "41771983423143937",\n  "channel_id": "127121515262115840",\n  "self_mute": false,\n  "self_deaf": false\n}\n```\n\n#### Update Status\n\nSent by the client to indicate a presence or status update.\n\n###### Gateway Status Update Structure\n\n| Field  | Type                                                     | Description                                                                                 |\n| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| since  | ?integer                                                 | unix time (in milliseconds) of when the client went idle, or null if the client is not idle |\n| game   | ?[activity](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/activity-object) object | null, or the user\'s new activity                                                            |\n| status | string                                                   | the user\'s new [status](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-status-status-types)                    |\n| afk    | bool                                                     | whether or not the client is afk                                                            |\n\n###### Status Types\n\n| Status    | Description                    |\n| --------- | ------------------------------ |\n| online    | Online                         |\n| dnd       | Do Not Disturb                 |\n| idle      | AFK                            |\n| invisible | Invisible and shown as offline |\n| offline   | Offline                        |\n\n###### Example Gateway Status Update\n\n```json\n{\n  "since": 91879201,\n  "game": {\n    "name": "Save the Oxford Comma",\n    "type": 0\n  },\n  "status": "online",\n  "afk": false\n}\n```\n\n### Connecting and Resuming\n\n#### Hello\n\nSent on connection to the websocket.

The ready event can be the largest and most complex event the gateway will send, as it contains all the state required for a client to begin interacting with the rest of the platform.\n\n`guilds` are the guilds of which your bot is a member. They start out as unavailable when you connect to the gateway. As they become available, your bot will be notified via [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events. `private_channels` will be an empty array. As bots receive private messages, they will be notified via [Channel Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-create) events.\n\n###### Ready Event Fields\n\n| Field            | Type                                                                                 | Description                                                                |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| v                | integer                                                                              | [gateway protocol version](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-protocol-versions) |\n| user             | [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) object                                      | information about the user including email                                 |\n| private_channels | array                                                                                | empty array                                                                |\n| guilds           | array of [Unavailable Guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/unavailable-guild-object) objects | the guilds the user is in                                                  |\n| session_id       | string                                                                               | used for resuming connections                                              |\n| \\_trace          | array of strings                                                                     | used for debugging - the guilds the user is in                             |\n\n#### Resumed\n\nThe resumed event is dispatched when a client has sent a [resume payload](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume) to the gateway (for resuming existing sessions).\n\n###### Resumed Event Fields\n\n| Field   | Type             | Description                                    |\n| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| \\_trace | array of strings | used for debugging - the guilds the user is in |\n\n#### Invalid Session\n\nSent to indicate one of at least three different situations:\n\n- the gateway could not initialize a session after receiving an [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify)\n- the gateway could not resume a previous session after receiving an [Opcode 6 Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume)\n- the gateway has invalidated an active session and is requesting client action\n\nThe inner `d` key is a boolean that indicates whether the session may be resumable. See [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/connecting) and [Resuming](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resuming) for more information.\n\n###### Example Gateway Invalid Session\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 9,\n  "d": false\n}\n```\n\n### Channels\n\n#### Channel Create\n\nSent when a new channel is created, relevant to the current user.

At least, we like to think so, and this is our website, so our word is law, deal with it. Therefore it's a fact that our community is the best, and they make really awesome things that we want to share with developers to make their lives easier. From permissions calculators to embed visualizers to full libraries to interface with our API, there are so many great things that have come out of our community.\n\n## Libraries\n\nThe Discord team curates the following list of officially vetted libraries that conform to our APIs standards around authentication and rate limiting. Using custom implementations or non-compliant libraries which abuse the API or cause excessive rate limits may result in a **permanent** ban.\n\n###### Discord Libraries\n\n| Name | Language |\n|------|----------|\n| [discordcr](https://github.com/meew0/discordcr) | Crystal |\n| [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) | C# |\n| [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/NaamloosDT/DSharpPlus) | C# |\n| [dscord](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/dscord) | D |\n| [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) | Go |\n| [Discord4j](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J) | Java |\n| [Javacord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord) | Java |\n| [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) | Java |\n| [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) | JavaScript |\n| [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) | JavaScript |\n| [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) | Lua |\n| [RestCord](https://www.restcord.com/) | PHP |\n| [Yasmin](https://github.com/CharlotteDunois/Yasmin) | PHP |\n| [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) | Python |\n| [disco](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/disco) | Python |\n| [discordrb](https://github.com/meew0/discordrb) | Ruby |\n| [discord-rs](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/discord-rs) | Rust |\n| [Sword](https://github.com/Azoy/Sword) | Swift |\n\n## Permission Calculators\n\n[Permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions) in Discord are tricky. Luckily, we've got really smart people who love us and have made some great permissions calculators. If you're making a bot for others, and you're not sure how to properly calculate permissions or generate your [authorization URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/bot-authorization-flow), these are great tools:\n\n- [FiniteReality's Permissions Calculator](https://finitereality.github.io/permissions-calculator/?v=0)\n- [abalabahaha's Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#0)\n\n## Embed Visualizer\n\nWebhooks and embeds might seem like black magic. That's because they are, but let us help you demystify them a bit. This sweet embed visualizer lets you play around with JSON data and see exactly how it will look embedded in Discord. It even includes a webhook mode!\n\n- [LeoV's Embed Visualizer](https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer/)\n"},1804:function(e,n){e.exports='# Certified Devices\n\nBaked into Discord is the ability for hardware manufacturers to tell us a little more about the certified devices that are plugged into a user\'s computer. Unfortunately, no, you can\'t show that a user\'s PUBG Chicken Dinner was all thanks to the amazing TotallyRealHardware RGB Mouse and Keyboard Set Extraordinaire™, but you _can_ give them an amazing experience using your hardware with Discord!\n\n## How\'s it work?\n\nI\'m glad you asked!\n\n1. [Create an application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) for your hardware vendor—save the Client ID!\n2. Talk to Discord via one simple HTTP or WebSocket call\n3. Send us a [`SET_CERTIFIED_DEVICES`](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/set-certified-devices) WebSocket payload or equivalent HTTP POST whenever the state of the device changes\n\nYup, that\'s it. You give us the real-time info about any connected devices, and we\'ll handle the rest to make sure that anyone using your device will have an awesome experience. Your device will also have a `CERTIFIED` badge in Discord\'s audio settings, and really, who doesn\'t love badges?\n\n![](certified-device.png)\n\n## Connecting\n\n###### Querystring Parameters\n\n| Name      | Value                | Required  |\n| --------- | -------------------- | --------- |\n| v         | `1`                  | All       |\n| client_id | your app\'s client id | All       |\n| encoding  | `json`               | WebSocket |\n\nYou can send event updates to the following URIs:\n\n###### HTTP\n\n```\nhttp://127.0.0.1:PORT/rpc?v=1&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID\n```\n\n###### WebSocket\n\n```\nws://127.0.0.1:PORT?v=1&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&encoding=json\n```\n\n`PORT` is a range of ports from `6463` to `6473`. You should iterate over these ports with your request until one returns a success response code or succeeds with a socket connection. Keep track of that port number for the rest of the session.\n\nTo keep your hardware in sync with Discord, send updates any time the hardware mute is toggled, or one of the voice features like echo cancellation is enabled or disabled by the user. This lets Discord get out of the way of your optimization when you\'re in control, or help out when you\'re not, ensuring an awesome experience for anyone using your hardware.\n\nEach time you update, send a full array of `devices`, sorted by your preffered priority. That means if you want a specific headset to be the default that Discord will attempt to use, put it first in the array.\n\n## Getting Device UUID\n\nFor each device in the `SET_CERTIFIED_DEVICES` payload, there is an `id` field. This `id` should be the Window\'s device UUID, retrieved through the native Windows API. You\'ll get back something that looks like `{0.0.1.00000000}.{6cff2b76-44a8-46b9-b528-262ad8609d9f}`.\n\n>info\n>On macOS, the `id` will be the name of the device.\n\n###### Microphone Id Example\n\n```cpp\nid = waveInMessage((HWAVEIN)IntToPtr(index),\n                      DRV_QUERYFUNCTIONINSTANCEID,\n                      (DWORD_PTR)pstrEndpointId,\n

With Rich Presence from Discord, it just got so easy, a ~~caveman~~ Junior Dev could do it.\n\nIf you are testing a game integration with Rich Presence, other users will be able to see it. Please create a private test account and do not join any public servers while testing your integration.\n\n> info\n> If you want to stay up to date with the latest developer news from Discord and learn about new and exciting ways to work with us, sign up for our [developer newsletter](https://discordapp.com/dev-newsletter).\n\n## So, what is it?\n\nRich Presence allows you to leverage the totally overhauled \"Now Playing\" section in a Discord user's profile to help people play your game together. Rich game data—including duration, score, current boss or map, and so much more—lives inside Discord. You can spectate a friend's game directly from their profile popout, or party up via beautiful chat embeds with real-time information about open party slots and the party's in-game status. No more exchanging usernames and friend codes, or wondering if there's room for you to join. Rich Presence is a living invitation to play together, or to watch your friends kick butt.\n\n## Step 0: Get the SDK\n\nYou've decided you want to integrate with Rich Presence. Of course you did! It's awesome—just ask us. You can get the SDK from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc). Grab a release build or use our build scripts, and check out the examples while you're there! We support C, C++, Unity, and Unreal Engine out of the box. If we don't have a release type that fits your development needs, roll your own! It's all open-source.\n\nA quick note: our static pre-compiled library—the `.lib` file in the Windows release download—relies on the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145). If you distribute your game on Steam, make sure to check that box in your common redistributable settings.\n\nIf you want to use the dynamic library—`.dll`—you do not need the redistributable.\n\n## So, how does it work?\n\nWe worked hard to make using Discord's Rich Presence system as easy as possible. All you need is our header file—what you will interact with—and our library—where we did all the hard work for you—and you are ready to roll!\n\nIn the header file, you'll find six event-emitting callbacks:\n\n1.  `ready()`\n2.  `errored()`\n3.  `disconnected()`\n4.  `joinGame()`\n5.  `spectateGame()`\n6.  `joinRequest()`\n\nThese six callbacks make up the entirety of what you need to implement. Behind the scenes, we do all the heavy lifting for you.\n\nThe header file also contains the `Discord_RunCallbacks()` function. This invokes any pending callbacks from Discord on the calling thread (it's thread safe!).\n\n## Initialization\n\nThe first step in implementing Rich Presence is [creating an application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). Once you've created your application, note and save your `Client ID`. You will need this to initialize the SDK; this value will be referred to throughout this documentation as both `client_id` and `application_id`. Next, scroll down to the bottom of your application's page and hit the button that says \"Enable Rich Presence\". This will allow you to upload assets to your dashboard for later use.\n\nTo begin, you'll register your callback functions to the six `DiscordEventHandlers` and then call `Discord_Initialize()` with your `APPLICATION_ID`. If your game is distributed via Steam, you should also pass your application's Steam ID so Discord can launch your game through Steam:\n\n###### SDK Initialization Example\n\n```c\nvoid InitDiscord()\n{\n    DiscordEventHandlers handlers;\n    memset(&handlers, 0, sizeof(handlers));\n    handlers.ready = handleDiscordReady;\n    handlers.errored = handleDiscordError;\n    handlers.disconnected = handleDiscordDisconnected;\n    handlers.joinGame = handleDiscordJoinGame;\n    handlers.spectateGame = handleDiscordSpectateGame;\n    handlers.joinRequest = handleDiscordJoinRequest;\n\n    // Discord_Initialize(const char* applicationId, DiscordEventHandlers* handlers, int autoRegister, const char* optionalSteamId)\n    Discord_Initialize(\"418562325121990661\", &handlers, 1, \"1234\");\n}\n```\n\nA quick breakdown on the `Discord_Initialize()` function:\n\n- `applicationId`: your client_id/application_id\n- `handlers`: the callback functions you registered for each Discord event\n- `autoRegister`: whether or not to register an application protocol for your game on the player's computer—necessary to launch games from Discord\n- `optionalSteamId`: your game's Steam application id, if your game is distributed on Steam\n\nWhen you are ready to publish your integration, we recommend digging into the source code of the SDK and copying `discord_register.h`, `discord_register_win.cpp`, `discord_register_osx.m`, and `discord_register_linux.cpp` into your installation and update process. By registering your application protocols on installation and update, your players won't need to run the game before being able to interact with invites, Ask to Join, and spectating in Discord.\n\n> danger\n> **Shutting Down**\n\n> Don't leave so soon! But when you _do_ shut down your application, don't forget to call `Discord_Shutdown()`. This properly terminates the thread and allows your application to shut down cleanly.\n\n## Updating Presence\n\nThe core of Discord's Rich Presence SDK is the `Discord_UpdatePresence()` function. This is what sends your game data up to Discord to be seen and used by others. You should call `Discord_UpdatePresence()` any time something important in the presence payload changes.\n\n`Discord_UpdatePresence()` has a rate limit of one update per 15 seconds. Developers do not need to do anything to handle this rate limit. The SDK will queue up any presence updates sent in that window and send the newest one once the client is free to do so. If you are sending presence updates very frequently and wondering why you don't see your Discord presence changing, that's why!\n\n###### Update Presence Example\n\n```c\nvoid UpdatePresence()\n{\n    char buffer[256];\n    DiscordRichPresence discordPresence;\n    memset(&discordPresence, 0, sizeof(discordPresence));\n    discordPresence.state = \"In a Group\";\n    sprintf(buffer, \"Ranked | Mode: %d\", GameEngine.GetMode());\n    discordPresence.details = buffer;\n    discordPresence.endTimestamp = time(0) + 5 * 60;\n    discordPresence.largeImageKey = \"canary-large\";\n    discordPresence.smallImageKey = \"ptb-small\";\n    discordPresence.partyId = GameEngine.GetPartyId();\n    discordPresence.partySize = 1;\n    discordPresence.partyMax = 6;\n    discordPresence.matchSecret = \"4b2fdce12f639de8bfa7e3591b71a0d679d7c93f\";\n    discordPresence.spectateSecret = \"e7eb30d2ee025ed05c71ea495f770b76454ee4e0\";\n    discordPresence.instance = 1;\n    Discord_UpdatePresence(&discordPresence);\n}\n```\n\n###### Update Presence Payload\n\n```c\ntypedef struct DiscordRichPresence {\n    const char* state; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* details; /* max 128 bytes */\n    int64_t startTimestamp;\n    int64_t endTimestamp;\n    const char* largeImageKey; /* max 32 bytes */\n    const char* largeImageText; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* smallImageKey; /* max 32 bytes */\n    const char* smallImageText; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* partyId; /* max 128 bytes */\n    int partySize;\n    int partyMax;\n    const char* matchSecret; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* joinSecret; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* spectateSecret; /* max 128 bytes */\n    int8_t instance;\n} DiscordRichPresence;\n```\n\n###### Update Presence Payload Fields\n\n| parameter      | type     | description                                                                | example                                                    |\n| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| state          | char\\*   | the user's current party status                                            | \"Looking to Play\", \"Playing Solo\", \"In a Group\"            |\n| details        | char\\*   | what the player is currently doing                                         | \"Competitive - Captain's Mode\", \"In Queue\", \"Unranked PvP\" |\n| startTimestamp | int64_t  | epoch seconds for game start - including will show time as \"elapsed\"       | 1507665886                                                 |\n| endTimestamp   | int64_t  | epoch seconds for game end - including will show time as \"remaining\"       | 1507665886                                                 |\n| largeImageKey  | char\\*   | name of the uploaded image for the large profile artwork                   | \"default\"                                                  |\n| largeImageText | char\\*   | tooltip for the largeImageKey                                              | \"Blade's Edge Arena\", \"Numbani\", \"Danger Zone\"             |\n| smallImageKey  | char\\*   | name of the uploaded image for the small profile artwork                   | \"rogue\"                                                    |\n| smallImageText | char\\*   | tootltip for the smallImageKey                                             | \"Rogue - Level 100\"                                        |\n| partyId        | char\\*   | id of the player's party, lobby, or group                                  | \"ae488379-351d-4a4f-ad32-2b9b01c91657\"                     |\n| partySize      | int      | current size of the player's party, lobby, or group                        | 1                                                          |\n| partyMax       | int      | maximum size of the player's party, lobby, or group                        | 5                                                          |\n| matchSecret    | char\\*   | [deprecated Notify Me feature, may be re-used in future]                   | MmhuZToxMjMxMjM6cWl3amR3MWlqZA==                           |\n| spectateSecret | char\\*   | unique hashed string for Spectate button                                   | MTIzNDV8MTIzNDV8MTMyNDU0                                   |\n| joinSecret     | char\\*   | unique hashed string for chat invitations and Ask to Join                  | MTI4NzM0OjFpMmhuZToxMjMxMjM=                               |\n| instance       | int8_t   | [deprecated Notify Me feature, may be re-used in future]                   | 1                                                          |\n\n> info\n> Sending `endTimestamp` will **always** have the time displayed as \"remaining\" until the given time.

This invite is tied to the player's party information; if their `partyId` changes, the invite will expire. If their `partySize` and `partyMax` changes, the invite will add, remove, and fill up slots dynamically.\n\nOther Discord users can click \"Join\" on the invitation. Their game will then launch, and the `joinGame()` callback will fire in their client with the inviting player's `joinSecret`. The client should reverse hash or otherwise unencrypt this secret and match the players together.\n\n### Ask to Join\n\n> warn\n> Requires Approval\n\nTo enable the Ask to Join button on your players' profiles, you'll need to be approved by us. Submit your integration for approval on your [app's developer dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). While there, you can also whitelist individual accounts for testing. Those accounts will have the Ask to Join button enabled on their profiles. For an in-depth explanation of what we look for during approval, see [Getting Approved](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_GETTING_APPROVED/).\n\nWhen Player B clicks the Ask to Join button on Player A's profile, the `joinRequest()` callback fires for Player A, sending the following data:\n\n###### Ask to Join Payload\n\n```c\ntypedef struct DiscordJoinRequest {\n    char userId[32];\n    char username[344];\n    char discriminator[8]\n    char avatar[128];\n} DiscordJoinRequest;\n```\n\n###### Ask to Join Payload Fields\n\n| parameter     | type      | description                                                                                                                         |\n| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| userId        | char[24]  | the userId of the player asking to join                                                                                             |\n| username      | char[344] | the username of the player asking to join                                                                                           |\n| discriminator | char[8]   | the discriminator of the player asking to join                                                                                      |\n| avatar\\*      | char[128] | the avatar hash of the player asking to join—see [image formatting](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting) for how to retrieve the image |\n\n> warn\n> `avatar` can be an empty string if the user has not uploaded an avatar to Discord\n\nWhen it fires, your game should surface this data with a Yes or No choice for Player A to accept whether or not they wish to play with Player B. Then, call `Discord_Respond()` with Player B's `userId` and the appropriate response code:\n\n###### Ask to Join Response Codes\n\n| code                 | value |\n| -------------------- | ----- |\n| DISCORD_REPLY_NO     | 0     |\n| DISCORD_REPLY_YES    | 1     |\n| DISCORD_REPLY_IGNORE | 2     |\n\nThe Ask to Join request persists for 30 seconds after the request is received, regardless of whether you have called `Discord_RunCallbacks()` within that window. Therefore, keep these two points in mind:\n\n- Ensure you call `Discord_RunCallbacks()` as frequently as possible to ensure your game client is up to date with any data from Discord\n- If the player is in a state in which they cannot interact with an Ask to Join request—like in the middle of a match—you should not send a `joinSecret` in the presence payload\n\n## Spectating\n\n> warn\n> Requires Approval\n\nTo enable the Spectate button on your players' profiles, you'll need to be approved by us. Submit your integration for approval on your [app's developer dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). While there, you can also whitelist individual accounts for testing. Those accounts will have the Spectate button enabled on their profiles. For an in-depth explanation of what we look for during approval, see [Getting Approved](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_GETTING_APPROVED/).\n\n#### Relevant Callbacks:\n\n`spectateGame()`\n\n#### Relevant Payload Data:\n\n`spectateSecret`\n\nWhen you send the relevant payload data in the `Discord_UpdatePresence()` call, your player will gain the ability to invite a Discord chat channel to spectate their game. This invite is tied to the `matchSecret` and will expire when it changes.\n\nOther Discord users can click \"Spectate\" on the invitation. Their game will launch, and the `spectateGame()` callback will fire in their client with the original player's `spectateSecret`. The client should reverse hash or otherwise unencrypt this secret and spectate that player's game.\n\n## Secrets\n\nSecurity is of the utmost importance to us here at Discord, and we know it is for you, too. That's why we want to make sure that you properly understand `matchSecret`, `joinSecret`, and `spectateSecret` so that your game data is safe and secure over the wire.\n\nTo keep security on the up and up, Discord requires that you properly hash/encode/encrypt/put-a-padlock-on-and-swallow-the-key-but-wait-then-how-would-you-open-it your secrets.\n\nSecrets are obfuscated data of your choosing. They could be match ids, player ids, lobby ids, etc. You should send us data that someone else's game client would need to join or spectate their friend. If you can't or don't want to support those actions, you don't need to send us secrets.\n\n## Rich Presence Field Requirements\n\nAll fields in the `DiscordRichPresence` object are entirely optional. Anything you choose to omit simply won't be displayed; the UI will dynamically adapt from the full Rich Presence object all the way down to the basic presence view. We highly encourage you to include as many fields as you can to make your game as attractive and interactive for other players as possible. However, if you choose to be a bit more selective, here's a handy table for what each piece of Rich Presence requires:\n\n###### Rich Presence Field Requirements\n\n|     Field      | Custom Artwork | Spectating | Joining | Ask to Join |\n| :------------: | :------------: | :--------: | :-----: | :---------: |\n|     state      |                |            |         |             |\n|    details     |                |            |         |             |\n| startTimestamp |                |            |         |             |\n|  endTimestamp  |                |            |         |             |\n| largeImageKey  |       x        |            |         |             |\n| smallImageKey  |       x        |            |         |             |\n| largeImageText |       x        |            |         |             |\n| smallImageText |       x        |            |         |             |\n|    partyId     |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n|   partySize    |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n|    partyMax    |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n|  matchSecret   |                |            |         |             |\n|   joinSecret   |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n| spectateSecret |                |     x      |         |             |\n|    instance    |                |            |         |             |  |\n\n## Your New Developer Dashboard\n\nIncluded with the launch of Rich Presence is an overhaul of Discord's Developer Dashboard. We want to make Rich Presence as easy as possible to use. Our first step is helping you ditch your CDN. You're welcome.\n\nOK, well, not entirely. But! Discord _will_ host any and all artwork that you need to have the very richest of presences. Upload an image, tag it with a key—preferrably one you can remember—and **bam**. It's ready for Rich Presence use. Head over to your [applications page](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top) to check it out!\n\n> warn\n> **Asset keys are automatically normalized to lowercase**. Be mindful of this when referring to them in your code.\n\n## A note on testing and Game Detection\n\nIn order to test your Rich Presence integration locally, you and your testers will need to make sure that your game client is detected by Discord. If your game is not automatically detected, presence data will not be shown. To detect your game, go to User Settings -> Games -> Add it! and select your application from the dropdown list. Every user working with your local development build will need to follow these steps in order for Discord to detect their presence.\n\nIf you don't see Rich Presence data in your profile while testing, make sure you have the correct process selected for Game Detection. Also make sure you don't have multiple instances of Discord running—if you do, your presence might be changing in one of those!\n\nIf you are having issues with your release build not being detected, send us an email at [gamedevs@discordapp.com](mailto:gamedevs@discordapp.com) and we'll add it to our database for you. If you distribute your game via Steam, Discord will auto-detect your game if it is marked as released and running from Steam. Local testing clients and un-released games may still need to be manually added.\n\nIf you're testing on your own, we recommend [downloading two separate release channels](https://discordapp.com/download) of the Discord desktop client. You can log into the stable, public test, and canary builds with separate credentials, making testing easier for a single developer.\n\n## So, what now?\n\nGet to coding! We can't wait to see the awesome integration you come up with. If you need some quick questions answered, look no further than our [Rich Presence FAQ](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_FAQ/). If you want to know how to make your integration the best it can be, read our [Best Practices Guide](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_BEST_PRACTICES/). If you're ready to release, consult our [Launch Checklist](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST/) and make sure you haven't missed anything!\n"},1807:function(e,n){e.exports="# Getting Approved for Spectate and Ask to Join\n\nFor the majority of Rich Presence, we do not require any sort of approval or whitelisting. You are free to update presence data and create join and spectate chat invites without us looking it over. However, if you want to add the “Spectate” and “Ask to Join” buttons on your players’ profiles, we want to take a look first and ensure that you get any support you might need.\n\nYou’ll need to have the following prepared for the approval process:\n\n- For Ask to Join, a video demonstrating your integration of the feature\n- For Spectate, a video demonstrating your integration of the feature\n- For both, screenshots of a Discord profile with your data in various states\n\nThese submissions should be in a polished, finalized state rather than works in progress.\n\n## Screenshots\n\nBecause you’re taking the extra steps to integrate more deeply with Discord, we want to make sure you have the resources you need to make your profile data look great. We will ask you to submit screenshots for each “state” of your game in which you send data. That doesn’t mean you need to send a separate screenshot for every conceivable map and dungeon. We want to see states like “Main Menu”, “In Queue”, “In Lobby”, and your various game modes.\n\nFor example, here’s a screenshot for a fictional games’s Capture the Flag mode:\n\n![](rp-profile-example-2.png)\n\nAnd another fictional game, where players are fighting a boss:\n\n![](rp-profile-example-1.png)\n\nBe sure to check out our [Best Practices Guide](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_BEST_PRACTICES/) before submitting!\n\n## Ask to Join Video\n\nAsk to Join is a feature that allows you to display a button on your players’ profiles while they’re playing your game. Their friends in Discord can click that Ask to Join button to request an invite to the group. Here’s an example!\n\n![](ask-to-join.gif)\n\nTo be approved for Ask to Join, submit a video of your game’s Ask to Join flow that looks something like the above example. Specifically, we want to see:\n\n#### Player A\n\n- Clicks Ask to Join on a friend’s profile\n- Receives an acceptance\n- Hits “Join” and the game launches\n- Placed into the party with Player B\n\n#### Player B\n\n- Receives in-game notification about the request\n- Is directed to act on the notification by accepting, denying, or ignoring\n- Accepts the request\n- Player A is placed into their party\n\nTo test Ask to Join for your game, you can add whitelisted users on [your app's developer dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) who will then have the feature enabled on their profile.\n\n## Spectate Video\n\nIf your game supports spectating, you probably want to apply for our Spectate feature as well! This displays a button on your players’ profiles that allows their friends to easily spectate their game. Clicking the button will launch the game client into its specific spectate mode. Here’s an example!\n\n![](spectate.gif)\n\nTo be approved for Spectate, submit a video of your game’s Spectate flow that looks something like the above example. Specifically, we want to see:\n\n#### Player\n\n- Clicks Spectate on a friend’s profile\n- Game client launches\n- Begin spectating friend\n\nIn the case of spectating, your players should not be able to join the game directly. If you want players to be able to join a game session, use our Ask to Join feature instead. Discord’s Spectate feature is limited to a “true spectate” experience—that means no joining on.\n\nTo test Spectate for your game, you can add whitelisted users on [your app's developer dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) who will then have the feature enabled on their profile.\n"},1808:function(e,n){e.exports="# Rich Presence FAQ\n\nBelow are answers to some common questions about integrating Rich Presence with your game. If you don't see your question answered here, feel free to reach out to [gamedevs@discordapp.com](mailto:gamedevs@discordapp.com) for more help.\n\n#### Q: I don't see any playing status for my game.\n\nDiscord is most likely not automatically detecting the test build for your game because it's running from a directory we aren't looking for. In order to add your test build, go to your user settings in Discord, then to the \"Games\" subsection, click \"Add it!\", and select your process from the drop-down list.\n\n#### Q: I see \"Playing MyGame\", but no Rich Presence data.\n\nThere's a couple things that could be going on:\n\n- If you're running two instances of the Discord client, check both!\n- Double check that your `Discord_Initialize()` function is correct.\n\nThroughout development, make sure you have your `errored()` and `disconnected()` callbacks hooked up for debugging. You can open up the console in Discord and look for errors pertaining to `SET_ACTIVITY` for more information as well.\n\n#### Q: I'm not seeing Spectate or Ask to Join buttons on my profile.\n\nMake sure you applied for approval! If you want these buttons on your players' profiles, we require your integration to go through an approval process. If you have applied and have been approved and still don't see the buttons, check your Discord console for errors.\n\n#### Q: What happens if someone has more than one game running that supports Rich Presence?\n\nDiscord will show presence for whichever game is currently focused or was most recently focused.\n\n#### Q: What if someone looking at my profile or an invite doesn't own the game?\n\nAnyone can see your profile data, whether they own the game or not. They'll only be able to interact with chat invites or profile buttons if they own the game and have launched it at least once. Otherwise, the invite/button tooltip will show \"Game Not Detected\".\n\n#### Q: Do join invitations allow players to select the number of open slots?\n\nCurrently, the SDK does not support this. Party slot information is determined by the party data you sent in your presence payload.\n\n#### Q: Can I send images via the payload rather than uploading them to my Developer Dashboard?\n\nUnfortunately, the SDK does not support this feature right now.  However, we hear your desires! We know that a lot of games, like customization-heavy RPGs, would benefit greatly from being able to programmatically upload assets. It may be something we tackle in the future.\n\n#### Q: Can I change something in the SDK for my own purposes?\n\nGo nuts! The SDK is open source by design. If you need or want to change something for the purposes of your specific integration—like changing our JSON parser, or changing all of the variable names to the names of your pets—go ahead and tinker to your heart's content.\n\n#### Q: OK—I've got it working! Now, how do I make my integration look _awesome_?\n\nI'm happy ~~we preempted your question~~ you asked! Check out our [Rich Presence Best Practices](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_BEST_PRACTICES/) guide for a rundown on how to make your integration the best that it can be!\n"},1809:function(e,n){e.exports="# Rich Presence Best Practices\n\nRich Presence is a new feature from Discord that allows you to surface unique, interesting, and actionable data inside a Discord user’s profile when they play your game! This guide is intended to show some best practices on how to make that data the best it can be. It will include images and code samples; for full technical documentation, see our developer documentation.\n\nIf you take away one thing from this guide, let it be this:\n\n>warn\n>Rich Presence data should give others a clear understanding of what someone is doing so they can decide if they want to play together or not.\n\n## Who should use Rich Presence?\n\nRich Presence is a powerful way to integrate your game with Discord. To do it most effectively, you should think about its purpose and how well (or not) it matches with your game and your implementation. Rich Presence is designed for these three things:\n\n1. Show interesting, unique, actionable data in a user’s profile\n2. Allow friends to spectate each other’s games\n3. Join a friend’s in-game party or server directly from Discord\n\nWe certainly don’t want to stifle creativity, especially for games that can use Rich Presence in an interesting way. However, keep in mind that this sort of gameplay is what it was designed for, and how players will normally interact with it.\n\nIf you want to do something creative, wacky, funky, or otherwise out-there with Rich Presence for your players and aren’t sure if you can, feel free to drop us a line at [gamedevs@discordapp.com](mailto:gamedevs@discordapp.com). We’re always happy to help!\n\n## How should you think about the data you show?\n\nThe data in your players’ profiles is the first thing that others on Discord will see about your game, both those familiar with it and those who have never played. It should answer two questions: can I play with my friend right now, and if not, when can I? Show data like:\n\n- What the player is currently doing\n- How much time has elapsed or remains (if applicable)\n- Their party state\n- Your cool artwork!\n\nFor a great real world example, check out [Holodrive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370770/Holodrive/) for free on Steam!\n\n## Tips\n\n### Keep it Short\n\n- `details` and `state` should be snippets of data, not sentences.\n- Make sure your strings stay on one line—especially on the small profile!\n\n###### Examples\n\n| Bad | Good |\n|:-----:|:----: |\n| ![](rp-long-strings.png) | ![](rp-short-strings.png) |\n| The data wraps onto multiple lines. It’s repetitive, slower to read, and messy. | The data all fits on one line per string. Clean! |\n\n### Make it Actionable!\n\n- Always keep party size data up to date.\n- Keep accurate track of party state: In Queue, In Game, In Menus, etc.\n- Include game modes, ranked vs. unranked, etc. so others can clearly see.\n\n###### Examples\n\n| Bad | Good |\n|:-----:|:----: |\n| ![](rp-non-actionable.png) | ![](rp-actionable.png) |\n| While Rank 9999 is impressive, it doesn’t present any actionable data for their friends. | This player is in queue for something I want to play. Let's ask to join that open spot! |\n\n### Use ALL of the fields (where applicable)!\n\n- Make use of all the fields that are applicable to you.\n- Save space by putting map and character names in the tooltips.\n- Try not to repeat information.\n\n###### Examples\n\n| Bad | Good |\n|:-----:|:----: |\n| ![](rp-not-all-fields.png) | ![](rp-all-fields.png) |\n| The map name takes up space and makes the player's status harder to read at a glance. | Moving the name of the map to the tooltip makes the data cleaner and frees up space for the score. |\n\n### Have interesting, expressive art!\n\n- The large image should be consistent for all players in a party.\n- The small image is where you can customize on a per-player basis.\n- Use high resolution artwork so your art looks great on fancy, high DPI screens.\n- We strongly recommend image sizes of 1024x1024 pixels.\n\n###### Examples\n\n| Bad | Good |\n|:-----:|:----: |\n| ![](rp-bad-art.png) | ![](rp-good-art.png)|\n| The image is dark and unfocused. Highly-detailed images can be hard to see. | This image is bright and matches the details.

Users can spawn across the entire platform, be members of\nguilds, participate in text and voice chat, and much more. Users are separated by a distinction of "bot" vs "normal." Although they are similar, bot users are automated users that are "owned" by another user. Unlike normal users, bot users do\n_not_ have a limitation on the number of Guilds they can be a part of.\n\n## Avatar Data\n\nAvatar data is a [Data URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) that supports JPG, GIF, and PNG formats. An example Data URI format is:\n\n```\ndata:image/jpeg;base64,BASE64_ENCODED_JPEG_IMAGE_DATA\n```\n\nEnsure you use the proper header type (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`) that matches the image data being provided.\n\n## Usernames and Nicknames\n\nDiscord enforces the following restrictions for usernames and nicknames:\n\n1.  Names can contain most valid unicode characters. We limit some zero-width and non-rendering characters.\n2.  Names must be between 2 and 32 characters long.\n3.  Names are sanitized and trimmed of leading, trailing, and excessive internal whitespace.\n\nThe following restrictions are additionally enforced for usernames:\n\n1.  Names cannot contain the following substrings: \'@\', \'#\', \':\', \'\\```\'.\n2.  Names cannot be: \'discordtag\', \'everyone\', \'here\'.\n\nThere are other rules and restrictions not shared here for the sake of spam and abuse mitigation, but the majority of users won\'t encounter them. It\'s important to properly handle all error messages returned by Discord when editing or updating names.\n\n### User Object\n\n###### User Structure\n\n| Field         | Type      | Description                                                | Required OAuth2 Scope |\n| ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |\n| id            | snowflake | the user\'s id                                              | identify              |\n| username      | string    | the user\'s username, not unique across the platform        | identify              |\n| discriminator | string    | the user\'s 4-digit discord-tag                             | identify              |\n| avatar        | ?string   | the user\'s [avatar hash](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting) | identify              |\n| bot?          | bool      | whether the user belongs to an OAuth2 application          | identify              |\n| mfa_enabled?  | bool      | whether the user has two factor enabled on their account   | identify              |\n| locale?       | string    | the user\'s chosen language option                          | identify              |\n| verified?     | bool      | whether the email on this account has been verified        | email                 |\n| email?        | string    | the user\'s email                                           | email                 |\n\n###### Example User\n\n```json\n{\n  "id": "80351110224678912",\n  "username": "Nelly",\n  "discriminator": "1337",\n  "avatar": "8342729096ea3675442027381ff50dfe",\n  "verified": true,\n  "email": "nelly@discordapp.com"\n}\n```\n\n### Connection Object\n\nThe connection object that the user has attached.\n\n###### Connection Structure\n\n| Field        | Type   | Description                                                                         |\n| ------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| id           | string | id of the connection account                                                        |\n| name         | string | the username of the connection account                                              |\n| type         | string | the service of the connection (twitch, youtube)                                     |\n| revoked      | bool   | whether the connection is revoked                                                   |\n| integrations | array  | an array of partial [server integrations](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/integration-object) |\n\n## Get Current User % GET /users/@me\n\nReturns the [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) object of the requester\'s account.

Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their `parent_id` removed and a [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-update) Gateway event will fire for each of them. Returns a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object on success. Fires a [Channel Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-delete) Gateway event.\n\n>warn\n>Deleting a guild channel cannot be undone. Use this with caution, as it is impossible to undo this action when performed on a guild channel. In contrast, when used with a private message, it is possible to undo the action by opening a private message with the recipient again.\n\n## Get Channel Messages % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages\n\nReturns the messages for a channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the \'VIEW_CHANNEL\' permission to be present on the current user. If the current user is missing the \'READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY\' permission in the channel then this will return no messages (since they cannot read the message history). Returns an array of [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) objects on success.\n\n>info\n>The before, after, and around keys are mutually exclusive, only one may be passed at a time.\n\n###### Query String Params\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Required | Default |\n|-------|------|-------------|----------|---------|\n| around | snowflake | get messages around this message ID | false | absent |\n| before | snowflake | get messages before this message ID | false | absent |\n| after | snowflake | get messages after this message ID | false | absent |\n| limit | integer | max number of messages to return (1-100) | false | 50 |\n\n## Get Channel Message % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}\n\nReturns a specific message in the channel.

If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the \'SEND_MESSAGES\' permission to be present on the current user. If the `tts` field is set to `true`, the SEND_TTS_MESSAGES permission is required for the message to be spoken. Returns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object. Fires a [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) Gateway event. See [message formatting](#DOCS_REFERENCE/message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.\n\nThe maximum request size when sending a message is 8MB.\n\n>warn\n>This endpoint supports both JSON and form data bodies. It does require multipart/form-data requests instead of the normal JSON request type when uploading files. Make sure you set your `Content-Type` to `multipart/form-data` if you\'re doing that. Note that in that case, the `embed` field cannot be used, but you can pass an url-encoded JSON body as a form value for `payload_json`.\n\n###### Params\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Required |\n|-------|------|-------------|----------|\n| content | string | the message contents (up to 2000 characters) | true |\n| nonce | snowflake | a nonce that can be used for optimistic message sending | false |\n| tts | bool | true if this is a TTS message | false |\n| file | file contents | the contents of the file being sent | one of content, file, embeds (`multipart/form-data` only) |\n| embed | [embed](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/embed-object) object | embedded `rich` content | false |\n| payload_json | string | url-encoded JSON body used in place of the `embed` field | `multipart/form-data` only\n\n>info\n>For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.\n\n###### Using Attachments within Embeds\n\nYou can upload attachments when creating a message and use those attachments within your embed. To do this, you will want to upload files as part of your `multipart/form-data` body. Make sure that you\'re uploading files that contain a filename, as you will need a filename to reference against.\n\nIn the embed object, you can then set an image to use an attachment as its url with our attachment scheme syntax: `attachment://filename.png`\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t"embed": {\n\t\t"image": {\n\t\t\t"url": "attachment://screenshot.png"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n>warn\n>Only filenames with proper image extensions are supported for the time being.\n\n## Create Reaction % PUT /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions/{emoji#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object}/@me\n\nCreate a reaction for the message. This endpoint requires the \'READ\\_MESSAGE\\_HISTORY\' permission to be present on the current user.  Additionally, if nobody else has reacted to the message using this emoji, this endpoint requires the \'ADD\\_REACTIONS\' permission to be present on the current user. Returns a 204 empty response on success.\n\n## Delete Own Reaction % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions/{emoji#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object}/@me\n\nDelete a reaction the current user has made for the message.

All documentation and functionality can and will change.\n\nIf your game has DLC or offers in-app purchases, this manager is for you! The Store Manager allows you to fetch a users\' entitlements, as well as being notified when a user is granted an entitlement from a purchase flow for your game.\n\n## Application Test Mode\n\nWith this new Store Manager comes a new fun toggle in the Discord app itself: Application Test Mode! While in Application Test Mode, you can freely make "purchases" of SKUs tied to your application. That means you can test buying your game, buying DLC, or going through an IAP flow without any credit card charges.\n\n> info\n> You still need to have a valid payment method on file to "purchase" SKUs in Application Test Mode; it just won\'t be charged at checkout.\n\nTo enable it, first make sure you have a payment method on file in User Settings -> Billing. Then:\n\n1.  Open up the Discord app\n2.  Click on the settings cog in the bottom left corner\n3.  Go to Appearance -> allll the way at the bottom\n4.  Toggle "Developer Mode" **on** and "Application Test Mode" **on**, and enter your application ID\n5.  Exit user settings\n\nYou should now see an orange bar across the top of your screen; this means it worked! The dropdown in the orange bar will show you all the available SKUs for that application; you can select one of them to go to its store page.\n\nIf for some reason the "Purchase/Install" button is greyed out, please check the following:\n\n1.  Do you have a `LIVE_BUILD_ID` on the master branch for this SKU? Check with `dispatch branch list <application_id>`.\n2.  Do you have a price tier set for this SKU? If not, pick one!\n\nOnce those two conditions are met, you should be good to go! Entitlements "purchased" with this mode enabled can be revoked with the `DELETE /entitlements` HTTP endpoint, documented below.\n\nIf you are testing IAP flows, you\'ll want to instead follow the instructions to enable Application Developer Mode in your Discord desktop client.\n\n## Checking DLC Entitlements\n\nIf your game has DLC, and a user has purchased that DLC, you may want to check what they should have access to when the game launches. DLC entitlements will always be returned in a `FetchEntitlements()` call, so your game can check on each startup whether or not a user should have access to a certain new zone, raid, map, etc. based on their entitlements for DLC.\n\n## Checking Consumable Entitlements\n\nThe `Discord.SkuType.Consumable` type is used for entitlements that may be "consumed" by a game\'s own server infrastructure. That is to say that if you have in-app purchases like gem bundles, skins, etc., they will be a `Consumable` SKU type.\n\nWhat that means is that your game is expected to "consume" these entitlements by doing something on your game server—giving the player a level, more coins, a skin, etc.—and then telling Discord that\'s been done by calling the `POST /entitlements/<id>/consume`, documented below. Then, Discord will remove that entitlement, as the player has been given whatever they purchased.\n\nEntitlements to consumable SKUs are intended to signal your game\'s server/service/database that the user should get something in-game, and that the entitlement should be removed afterwards.\n\nThe same consumable SKU _can_ be purchased multiple times, even before consuming any of them. Non-consumable SKUs can only be purchased once.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### SKU Struct\n\n| name  | type     | description              |\n| ----- | -------- | ------------------------ |\n| Id    | Int64    | the unique ID of the SKU |\n| Type  | SkuType  | what sort of SKU it is   |\n| Name  | string   | the name of the SKU      |\n| Price | SkuPrice | the price of the SKU     |\n\n###### SkuType Enum\n\n| name        | value | description                                    |\n| ----------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| Application | 1     | SKU is a game                                  |\n| DLC         | 2     | SKU is a DLC                                   |\n| Consumable  | 3     | SKU is a consumable (in-app purchase)          |\n| Bundle      | 4     | SKU is a bundle (comprising the other 3 types) |\n\n###### SkuPrice Struct\n\n| name     | type   | description                       |\n| -------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |\n| Amount   | UInt32 | the amount of money the SKU costs |\n| Currency | string | the currency the amount is in     |\n\n###### Entitlement Struct\n\n| name  | type            | description                                     |\n| ----- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Id    | Int64           | the unique ID of the entitlement                |\n| Type  | EntitlementType | the kind of entitlement it is                   |\n| SkuId | Int64           | the ID of the SKU to which the user is entitled |\n\n###### EntitlementType Enum\n\n| name                | value | description                                                 |\n| ------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Purchase            | 1     | entitlement was purchased                                   |\n| PremiumSubscription | 2     | entitlement for being a Discord Nitro subscriber            |\n| DeveloperGift       | 3     | entitlement was gifted by a developer                       |\n| TestModePurchase    | 4     | entitlement was purchased by a dev in application test mode |\n| FreePurchase        | 5     | entitlement was granted when the SKU was free               |\n\n## FetchSkus\n\nFetches the list of SKUs for the connected application, readying them for iteration.\n\nReturns `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nstoreManager.FetchSkus((result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.OK)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Got skus!

All documentation and functionality can and will change.\n\nWelcome to the Store SDK! We're glad you made it. This SDK is here to solve all your problems, if your problems include finding an awesome SDK to help develop your game. Our SDK is like Clippy, if Clippy were built on a modern tech stack, talked less, and was an awesome game development SDK.\n\nSo, what's it do?\n\n## Features\n\n- Native C++ and C# bindings\n  - Feel right at home in our code\n- Authentication\n  - Information about the current player\n  - OAuth2 token for current player, to use against Discord's HTTP API\n- Activities (a.k.a Rich Presence)\n  - Spectate\n  - Request to Join\n  - Direct game invites\n  - Rich profile data\n- Relationships (Friends)\n  - Getting a user's Discord relationships, even implicit ones\n    - Users with whom they interact a lot, but aren't officially friends\n  - Filtering relationships to build a friends list\n  - Getting basic information about any Discord user (by id)\n  - Getting the current activity of a user relationship\n- Images\n  - Getting image data for a user's avatar for in-game display\n- Lobbies\n  - Creating, updating, deleting, joining, and leaving multiplayer lobbies\n  - Getting and setting metadata on lobbies and lobby members\n  - Sending and receiving chat messages between lobby members\n- Networking\n  - TCP-like API, but messsage-oriented UDP infrastructure\n    - \"Reliable\" channels for must-receive data, like loot drops!\n    - \"Unreliable\" channels for eventually consistent data, like players' positions\n  - P2P-like connections, routed through Discord's servers — No IP leaks!\n  - Encrypted\n- Overlay Interactions\n  - Open, lock, and unlock the Discord overlay\n  - Bring up an invite modal in the overlay for your players to invite their friends to play together\n- File Storage\n  - Save game data to a special local filepath\n  - We sync that to the _C L O U D_\n- DRM\n  - Built into our amazing build tool, Dispatch!\n  - Or, do your own entitlement checking!\n\n**Coming Real Soon**\n\n- In-app Purchase Support\n\n## Step 0 - Some Notes\n\nBefore we get off to the races, a couple notes on the SDK:\n\n- All strings in the SDK are UTF8 strings\n  - Make sure you've converted properly if necessary!\n- The SDK is **_NOT_** threadsafe!\n  - Being callback-based, we thought that'd be confusing and inconsistent\n\nAnd now you know, and knowing is half the battle.\n\n## Step 1 - Get the Thing\n\nI know you're already convinced, so let's begin. First, get the SDK. Right now, the SDK is not publically available. If you are one of our developer partners, you'll have access to it; if not, feel free to keep reading for the sake of learning! And hey, if you've got an awesome game, and _want_ to be one of our developer partners, [drop us a message](https://dis.gd/devstoreform).\n\nThere's a few things in there, but let's quickly talk about what the SDK actually _is_. Inside the `lib/` folder, you'll see `x86/` and `x86_64/` that have some `.lib`, `.bundle`, and `.dll` files. You'll also notice that those files are _really_ small, just a couple hundred kilobytes. What these are are stubs for the Discord SDK. These are the things you want to distribute with your game. When you initialize the SDK, these stubs will call back to the locally installed Discord app to actually do the things your game needs. That means that the SDK will launch Discord if it's not already launched, or give you an error if Discord is not installed.\n\nWe designed the SDK this way with two things in mind. First, it allows you as a developer to distribute the Discord SDK on other platforms. As long as the player has Discord running, the SDK will work no matter where the game is launched from. Secondly, it lets you get the latest updates without having to actually download and ship a new SDK version—all the updates will happen in the actual Discord client!\n\nYou'll also notice that there is a `runtime/` folder. Inside that folder are _actual_ full SDKs, not stubs. If you place these in certain root directories:\n\n- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\\.discord_game_sdk\\`\n- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.discord_game_sdk/`\n\nThe SDK will prioritize these DLLs instead of using the stub to call out to the Discord client. That way, if we've got a new build of the SDK you want to test locally, or we gave you a debug build for debugging help, you can stick it in those folders and use it temporarily.\n\n## Get Set Up\n\n> During the Beta period, we ask that you DO NOT create your own OAuth2 application. When you are ready to begin development, let someone on the Discord team know, and we will create an application for you and assign it to your account. We have some special flags that we need to enable on your behalf.\n\nNext, we need to set up the application for your game. An application is the base \"entity\" in Discord for your game; it's what all the builds, branches, SKUs, store pages, assets, etc. will be filed under. Ask a Discord team member to get an application created for you. Once that's done, head on over to our [developer site](https://discordapp.com/developers/) and click into the application created for you. Now, make it your own by changing it's name and giving it a new icon! There, all pretty.\n\nFirst, we'll need to set an OAuth2 redirect URL. You can add `http://127.0.0.1` in there for now; this powers some behind-the-scenes stuff you don't need to worry about.\n\nNext, enabled Rich Presence for your application (it's a big button near the bottom of the page). This gives you access to a whitelist of users that you can set and invite to test your SDK. When you're ready to test with users **that are not the direct owner of the application**, you'll need to add them to this list.\n\nFinally, copy the **Client ID** at the top of the page. This id, also referred to as an \"application id\", is your game's unique identifier across Discord. Keep it handy!\n\nNow we're gonna start coding. Didn't think we'd get there so fast, did ya? _Think again!_ The next sections are code primers for the main languages of the SDK: C#, C, and C++. They'll get you up and running with the most basic examples, and then you're off to the races.\n\n## Code Primer - Unity (Csharp)\n\n- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.\n- Copy the contents of the `lib/` folder to `Assets/Plugins` in your Unity project\n- Copy the contents of the `csharp/` folder to `Assets/Plugins/DiscordGameSDK`\n- It's dangerous to go alone—take this small code block with you (to start)!\n\n```cs\n// Grab that Client ID from earlier\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(CLIENT_ID, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n```\n\n- Make sure to call `discord.RunCallbacks()` in your main game loop; for Unity, that's your `Update()` function.\n\nDuring development, Discord will focus itself to ask for permission when you initialize the SDK. This will happen once a week (the duration of our OAuth2 tokens) for now, but will not happen at all in production.\n\nYou're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/Program.cs` in the SDK zip file.\n\n## Code Primer - Unreal Engine 4 (C)\n\n> info\n> An Unreal plugin is planned, however, you can use either the C or C++ bindings with Unreal today.\n\n- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.\n- Copy the contents of the `lib/` folder to the best location within your project for DLLs.\n- Copy the contents of the `c/` folder to your source directory\n- It's dangerous to go alone—take this small code block with you (to start)!\n\n```c\nstruct Application {\n    struct IDiscordCore* core;\n    struct IDiscordUsers* users;\n};\n\nstruct Application app;\n// Don't forget to memset or otherwise initialize your classes!\nmemset(&app, 0, sizeof(app));\n\nstruct IDiscordCoreEvents events;\nmemset(&events, 0, sizeof(events));\n\nstruct DiscordCreateParams params;\nparams.client_id = CLIENT_ID;\nparams.flags = DiscordCreateFlags_Default;\nparams.events = &events;\nparams.event_data = &app;\n\nDiscordCreate(0, &params, &app.core);\n```\n\n- Make sure to call `core->run_callbacks(core, 0)` in your game loop.\n\nDuring development, Discord will focus itself to ask for permission when you initialize the SDK. This will happen once a week (the duration of our OAuth2 tokens) for now, but will not happen at all in production.\n\nYou're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/c/main.c` in the SDK zip file.\n\n## Code Primer - Unreal Engine 4 (Cpp)\n\n> The C++ API shape is still in flux. Expect future revisions to not return discord::Result for every method and a shift from out parameters to return values.\n\n- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.\n- Copy the contents of the `lib/` folder to the best location within your project for DLLs.\n- Copy the contents of the `cpp/` folder to your source directory\n- It's dangerous to go alone—take this small code block with you (to start)!\n\n```cpp\n// Don't forget to memset or otherwise initialize your classes!\ndiscord::Core* core{};\nauto result = discord::Core::Create(CLIENT_ID, DiscordCreateFlags_Default, &core);\n```\n\n- Make sure to call `core->RunCallbacks()` in your game loop\n\nDuring development, Discord will focus itself to ask for permission when you initialize the SDK. This will happen once a week (the duration of our OAuth2 tokens) for now, but will not happen at all in production.\n\nYou're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/cpp/main.cpp` in the SDK zip file.\n\n## Testing Locally with Two Clients\n\nWhile integrating the Discord GameSDK, you will probably find yourself wanting to test functionality between two game clients locally, be it for networking, Rich Presence, etc.\n\nWe also know that getting a test build of a game on two separate machines can be both difficult and cumbersome. So, we've got a solution for you! By using system environment variables, you can tell the SDK in a certain game client to connect to a specific Discord client. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Download Discord Canary. This is our most updated build, and is good to develop against: [Windows](https://discordapp.com/api/download/canary?platform=win) - [Mac](https://discordapp.com/api/download/canary?platform=osx)\n2. Download a second Discord Build. Here's our Public Test Build: [Windows](https://discordapp.com/api/download/ptb?platform=win) - [Mac](https://discordapp.com/api/download/ptb?platform=osx)\n3. Open up two Discord clients. We recommend you develop against Discord Canary, so you can use PTB or Stable for your test account\n4. Log in with two separate users. Make sure any test account is added to the application's App Whitelist in the portal!\n\nNow, in your game code, you can tell the SDK which client to connect to via the environment variable `DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID` **before initializing the SDK**. The value of the variable corresponds to the order in which you opened the clients, so `0` would connect to the first opened client, `1` the second, etc.\n\n###### Environment Variable Example\n\n```cs\n// This machine opened Discord Canary first, and Discord PTB second\n\n// This makes the SDK connect to Canary\nSystem.Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(\"DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID\", \"0\");\nvar discord = new Discord(applicationId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n\n// This makes the SDK connect to PTB\nSystem.Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(\"DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID\", \"1\");\nvar discord = new Discord(applicationId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n```\n\nThis will set the environment variable only within the context of the running process, so don't worry about messing up global stuff.\n\n> danger\n> If you test with this, make sure to remove this code before pushing a production build. It will interfere with the way that Discord launches games for users.\n\n## Section Checklist\n\nThink of these like those end of section review pages from your history textbooks, but we won't give you a pop quiz. I promise. By now, you should have the following:\n\n- The SDK downloaded\n- An application created, and a Client ID you're keeping handy\n- Rich Presence enabled on that application\n- An OAuth2 redirect URL added to that application\n- The proper libraries, DLLs, and header files in the right places for your game\n- A working SDK, via the small code snippets above\n\nIf you can check all those boxes, you are doing great! You're well-equipped to venture forth into the rest of the SDK and make full use of it's myriad of functionality. So, onwards, to game development!\n\n## Where...do I go...\n\nOh, yeah.

All documentation and functionality can and will change.\n\nA note before starting: this documentation covers the "low layer" networking level of the Discord GameSDK. What that means is that using the network manager directly affords you the flexbility to update routes, open channels, and handle events directly emitted by the SDK. If you\'re looking for something a bit easier and faster to integrate, we recommend that you check out the networking wrapper around our lobby documentation: [Integrated Networking](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_LOBBIES/integrated-networking)\n\nNeed a networking layer? Have a networking layer! This manager handles all things packets so you can get data from player to player and make your multiplayer...work. It:\n\n- Functions as a connection-oriented, TCP-like API, but over UDP!\n- Supports "reliable" and "unreliable" connections\n  - Packets with loot in them always get there, but player positioning can be eventually consistent\n- Features P2P-like connections, but routed through Discord\'s high-end server infrastructure\n  - All the benefits of direct connections, without the IP leaks!\n- Is encrypted!\n\nAn important note to make here is that our networking layer **is not peer-to-peer**. Discord has always promised that we will not leak your IP, and we promise to keep it that way. Though it seems like you are connected directly to another user, it routes through Discord\'s servers in the middle, ensuring both security and robust networking thanks to our servers.\n\n## GetPeerId\n\nGet the networking peer ID for the current user, allowing other users to send packets to them.\n\nReturns a `UInt64`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar myPeerId = networkManager.GetPeerId();\n```\n\n## Flush\n\nFlushes the network. Run this at the end of your game\'s loop, once you\'ve finished sending all you need to send. In Unity, for example, stick this in `LateUpdate()`.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nOnLateUpdate()\n{\n  networkManager.Flush();\n}\n```\n\n## OpenChannel\n\nOpens a channel to a user with their given peer ID on the given channel number.\n\nUnreliable channels—`reliable = false`—should be used for loss-tolerant data, like player positioning in the world. Reliable channels—`reliable = true`—should be used for data that _must_ get to the user, like loot drops!\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name      | type   | description                                          |\n| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| peerId    | UInt64 | the peerId of the user to connect to                 |\n| channelId | byte   | the channel on which to connect                      |\n| reliable  | bool   | whether the channel should be unreliable or reliable |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\nvar peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\nnetworkManager.OpenChannel(peerId, 0, false);\n```\n\n## OpenPeer\n\nOpens a network connection to another Discord user.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type   | description                                  |\n| ------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |\n| peerId | UInt64 | the peerId of the user to connect to         |\n| route  | string | the route the user is currently broadcasting |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\nvar peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\nvar route = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.route");\nnetworkManager.OpenPeer(peerId, route);\n```\n\n## UpdatePeer\n\nUpdates the network connection to another Discord user. You\'ll want to call this when notified that the route for a user to which you are connected has changed, most likely from a lobby member update event.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type   | description                |\n| ------ | ------ | -------------------------- |\n| peerId | UInt64 | the user\'s peerId          |\n| route  | string | the new route for the user |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.OnMemberUpdate += (lobbyId, userId) =>\n{\n  var peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\n  var newRoute = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.route");\n  networkManger.UpdatePeer(peerId, newRoute);\n}\n```\n\n## SendMessage\n\nSends data to a given peer ID through the given channel.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name      | type   | description                     |\n| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |\n| peerId    | UInt64 | the peer id to connect to       |\n| channelId | byte   | the channel on which to connect |\n| data      | byte[] | the data to send                |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\nvar peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\n\nbyte[] lootDrops = GameEngine.GetLootData();\nnetworkManager.SendMessage(peerId, 1, lootDrops);\n```\n\n## CloseChannel\n\nClose the connection to a given user by peerId on the given channel.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name      | type   | description                               |\n| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |\n| peerId    | UInt64 | the peerId of the user to disconnect from |\n| channelId | byte   | the route to close                        |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\nvar peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\nnetworkManager.CloseChannel(peerId, 0);\nConsole.WriteLine("Channel {0} to {1} closed", 0, peerId);\n```\n\n## ClosePeer\n\nDisconnects the network session to another Discord user.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type   | description       |\n| ------ | ------ | ----------------- |\n| peerId | UInt64 | the user\'s peerId |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\nvar peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\nnetworkManager.ClosePeer(peerId);\nConsole.WriteLine("Connection to {0} closed", peerId);\n```\n\n## OnMessage\n\nFires when you receive data from another user. This callback will only fire if you already have an open channel with the user sending you data. Make sure you\'re running `RunCallbacks()` in your game loop, or you\'ll never get data!\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name      | type   | description                |\n| --------- | ------ | -------------------------- |\n| peerId    | UInt64 | the peer id of the sender  |\n| channelId | byte   | the channel it was sent on |\n| data      | byte[] | the data sent              |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nnetworkManager.OnMessage += (peerId, channel, data) =>\n{\n  var stringData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(data);\n  Console.WriteLine("Message from {0}: {1}", peerId, stringData)\n}\n```\n\n## OnRouteUpdate\n\nFires when your networking route has changed. You should broadcast to other users to whom you are connected that this has changed, probably by updating your lobby member metadata for others to receive.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name  | type   | description               |\n| ----- | ------ | ------------------------- |\n| route | string | the new route to the user |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nnetworkManager.OnRouteUpdate += route =>\n{\n  var me = userManager.GetCurrentUser();\n  var lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\n  var txn = lobbyManager.GetMemberUpdateTransaction(lobbyId, me.Id);\n  txn.SetMetadata("route", route);\n  lobbyManager.UpdateMember(lobbyId, me.Id, txn, (result) =>\n  {\n    // Who needs error handling anyway\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Flush vs RunCallbacks\n\nA quick note here may be helpful for the two functions that should be called continuously in your game loop: `discord.RunCallbacks()` and `networkManager.Flush()`. `RunCallbacks()` pumps the SDK\'s event loop, sending any newly-received data down the SDK tubes to your game. For this reason, you should call it at the beginning of your game loop; that way, any new data is handled immediately by callbacks you\'ve registered. In Unity, for example, this goes in `Update()`.\n\n`Flush()` is specific to the network manager. It actually _writes_ the packets out to the stream. You should call this at the _end_ of your game loop as a way of saying "OK, I\'m done with networking stuff, go send all the stuff to people who need it". In Unity, for example, this goes in `LateUpdate()`.\n\n## Connecting to Each Other\n\nThis manager is built around the concept of routes between players, and then channels on those routes. Player A opens a route to Player B. This route will change, most commonly if the user\'s external IP address changes. As that route changes, the player will receive `OnRouteUpdate` events. They should then alert other lobby members that their route has changed by updating their lobbymetadata. Other lobby members will see those updates from the `OnLobbyMemberUpdate` event, and can call `UpdateRoute()` accordingly. A user\'s route could change frequently, so architect your system anticipating frequent route changes and updates.\n\nOnce Player A has a route open to Player B, Player A then opens a channel to Player B, and Player B does the same to Player A. Channels are the pipes down which data is actually sent. These two users can now send data back and forth to each other with `SendMessage()` and receive it with `OnMessage`.\n\nIn order to properly send and receive data between A and B, both users need to have **the same type of channel** open to each other **on the same channel number**. If A has Reliable Channel 4 open to B, B also needs Reliable Channel 4 open to A.\n\n## Example: Connecting to Another Player in a Lobby\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n\n// Join a lobby with another user in it\n// Get their peer id, and connect to them\n\nvar networkManager = discord.GetNetworkManager();\nvar lobbyManager = discord.GetLobbyManager();\nvar userManager = discord.GetUserManager();\n\nvar me;\nvar otherUserPeerId;\nvar lobbyId;\n\n// Get yourself\nuserManager.GetCurrentUser((user) =>\n{\n  me = user;\n});\n\n// This will fire once you connect to the lobby\n// Telling you which route is yours\nnetworkManager.OnRouteUpdate += route =>\n{\n  var txn = lobbyManager.GetMemberUpdateTransaction();\n  txn.SetMetadata("route", route);\n  lobbyManager.UpdateMember(lobbyId, me.Id, txn, (result =>\n  {\n    // Who needs error handling anyway\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\n  }))\n}\n\n// When other users get new routes, they\'ll update their metadata\n// Fetch it and update their route\nlobbyManager.OnMemberUpdate += (lobbyId, userId) =>\n{\n  var peerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "peer_id");\n  var newRoute = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "route");\n  lobbyManger.UpdatePeer(peerId, newRoute);\n}\n\n// Connect to lobby with an id of 12345 and a secret of "password"\nlobbyManager.Connect(12345, "password", (lobby) =>\n{\n  lobbyId = lobby.Id;\n\n  // Add our own peer id to our lobby member metadata\n  // So other users can get it to connect to us\n  var txn = lobbyManager.CreateMemberUpdateTransaction();\n  txn.SetMetadata("peer_id", networkManager.GetPeerId());\n  lobbyManager.UpdateMember(lobby.Id, me.Id, txn, (result) =>\n  {\n    // Who needs error handling anyway\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\n  });\n\n  // Get the first member in the lobby, assuming someone is already there\n  var member = lobbyManager.GetMemberUserId(lobby.Id, 0);\n\n  // Get their peer id and route from their metadata, added previously\n  otherUserPeerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobby.Id, member.Id, "peer_id");\n  var otherRoute = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobby.Id, member.Id, "route");\n\n  // Connect to them\n  lobbyManager.OpenRoute(otherUserPeerId, otherRoute);\n\n}\n\n// Open an unreliable channel to the user on channel 0\n// And a reliable one on channel 1\nnetworkManager.OpenChannel(otherUserPeerId, 0, false);\nnetworkManager.OpenChannel(otherUserPeerId, 1, true);\n\n// An important data packet from our game engine\nbyte[] data = GameEngine.GetImportantData();\n\nif (isDataAboutPlayerLootDrops(data))\n{\n  // This is important and has to get there\n  // Send over reliable channel\n  networkManager.SendMessage(otherUserPeerId, 1, data);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // This is eventually consistent data, like the player\'s position in the world\n    // It can be sent over the unreliable channel\n    networkManager.SendMessage(otherUserPeerId, 0, data);\n}\n\n// Done; ship it!\nnetworkManager.Flush();\n```\n'},1825:function(e,n){e.exports='# Lobbies\n\n> danger\n> The Discord Store is still in a beta period. All documentation and functionality can and will change.\n\nLooking to integrate multiplayer into your game? Lobbies are a great way to organize players into contexts to play together. This manager works hand in hand with the networking layer of our SDK to make multiplayer integrations a breeze by:\n\n- Creating, managing, and joining lobbies\n- Matchmaking users based on lobby metadata, like ELO\n- Getting and setting arbitrary metadata on lobbies and lobby members\n\nLobbies in Discord work in one of two ways. By using calls from the SDK, lobbies are effectively "owned" by the user who\'s client creates the lobby. Someone boots up the game, hits your "Create Lobby" button, and their game client calls `LobbyManager.CreateLobby()` from the Discord SDK.\n\nThere is also another way to create and "own" lobbies with which the source of truth can be your own server. These SDK functions calls map to API endpoints that are exposed in Discord\'s HTTP API. In lieu of creating and managing lobbies in the SDK, you can call those endpoints directly with a token for your application and take care of it all on some far-away, totally secure server. Let\'s go over the SDK first.\n\n## The SDK Way\n\nIn order to ensure that Discord lobbies are consistent for all players, this manager works with "transactions". A `LobbyTransaction` is needed to set lobby properties, like capacity. A `MemberTransaction` is needed to set lobby member properties, like metadata.\n\nTo update a user or a lobby, create or get a transaction for that resource, call the needed methods on it, and then pass it to the `Create()` or `Update()` methods. When passed to a `Create()` or `Update()` method, the transaction objected is consumed. So, if you want to do another `Create()` or `Update()`, you need to get a new transaction.\n\n###### Example: Creating a Lobby\n\n```cs\nvar lobbyManager = discord.GetLobbyManager();\n\n// Create the transaction\nvar txn = LobbyManager.CreateLobbyTransaction();\n\n// Set lobby information\ntxn.SetCapacity(6);\ntxn.SetType(Discord.LobbyType.Public);\ntxn.SetMetadata("a", "123");\n\n// Create it!\nlobbyManager.CreateLobby(txn, (result, lobby) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("lobby {0} created with secret {1}", lobby.Id, lobby.Secret);\n\n  // We want to update the capacity of the lobby\n  // So

Lobbies in Discord are even more useful when hooked together with Activities/Rich Presence functionality; they give you everything you need to create an awesome game invite system.\n\nIf you are creating lobbies for users in the game client, and not on a backend server, consider using `GetLobbyActivitySecret` and `ConnectWithActivitySecret()`. `GetLobbyActivitySecret()` will return you a unique secret for the lobby concatenated with the lobby\'s id. You can pipe this value directly to the `Secrets.Join` field of the `Activity` payload. Then, when a user receives the secret, their client can call `ConnectWithActivitySecret()` with just the secret; the lobby id is parsed out automatically. This saves you the effort of concatenating the secret + id together yourself and then parsing them out again. As a code example:\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\nvar lobbyManager = discord.GetLobbyManager();\nvar activityManager = discord.GetActivityManager();\n\n// Create a lobby\nvar txn = lobbyManager.GetLobbyCreateTransaction();\ntxn.SetCapacity(5);\ntxn.SetType(Discord.LobbyType.Private);\n\nlobbyManager.CreateLobby(txn, (result, lobby) =>\n{\n  // Get the sepcial activity secret\n  var secret = lobbyManager.GetLobbyActivitySecret(lobby.id);\n\n  // Create a new activity\n  // Set the party id to the lobby id, so everyone in the lobby has the same value\n  // Set the join secret to the special activity secret\n  var activity = new Discord.Activity\n  {\n    Party =\n    {\n      Id = lobby.id,\n      Size = {\n        CurrentSize = 1,\n        MaxSize = 5\n      }\n    },\n    Secrets =\n    {\n      Join = secret\n    }\n  };\n\n  activityManager.UpdateActivity(activity, (result) =>\n  {\n    // Now, you can send chat invites, or others can ask to join\n    // When other clients receive the OnActivityJoin() event, they\'ll receive the special activity secret\n    // They can then directly call lobbyManager.ConnectLobbyWithActivitySecret() and be put into the lobby together\n  })\n});\n```\n\nIf you are creating lobbies with your own backend system (see the section below), this method may not be useful for you. In that case, you can use `Connect()` and pass the lobby id and secret as you normally would. If you\'re hooking up to Activities, just make sure you send both the lobby secret and the lobby id in the `Secrets.Join` field, so anyone who tries to join has the right data.\n\n### Example: Search for a Lobby, Connect, and Join Voice\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n\n// Search lobbies.\nvar query = lobbyManager.GetSearchQuery();\n\n// Filter by a metadata value.\nquery.Filter("metadata.ELO", Discord.LobbySearchComparison.EqualTo, Discord.LobbySearchCast.Number, "1337");\n\n// Only return 1 result max.\nquery.Limit(1);\n\nlobbyManager.Search(query, () =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("search returned {0} lobbies", lobbyManager.LobbyCount());\n\n  if (lobbyManager.LobbyCount() == 1)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("first lobby: {0}", lobbyManager.GetLobbyId(0));\n  }\n\n  // Get the id of the lobby, and connect to voice\n  var id = lobbyManager.GetLobbyId(0);\n  lobbyManager.ConnectVoice(id, (result) =>\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Connected to voice!");\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Example: Crossplayish\n\nSo, an explanation. Because the DLL that you ship with your game is a stub that calls out to the local Discord client for actual operations, the SDK does not necessarily care if the game was launched from Discord. As long as the player launching the game:\n\n1.  Has Discord installed\n2.  Has a Discord account\n3.  Has logged into Discord on their machine (whether or not Discord is open)\n\nThe SDK will function as if the game were launched from Discord and everything will work; if Discord is not currently launched, the SDK will launch it.\n\nThat means that if Player A is launching Your Amazing Game from Discord, and Player B is launching it from Other Cool But Not As Cool As Discord Game Store, as long as Player B meets the above criteria, both players can play with each other using Discord\'s lobbies + networking functions. If the SDK is not able to launch Discord for Player B—maybe they\'ve never installed/used Discord before!—you\'ll get an error saying as much. We\'re not saying what you _should_ do, but hey, wouldn\'t this make a really neat in-game touchpoint for your players to join their friends on Discord, and maybe even join your game\'s [verified server](https://discordapp.com/verification)?\n\nOK so this wasn\'t really a code example, but I think you get how this works.\n\n## The API Way\n\nBelow are the API endpoints and the parameters they accept. If you choose to interface directly with the Discord API, you will need a "Bot token". This is a special authorization token with which your application can access Discord\'s HTTP API. Head on over to [your app\'s dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/), and hit the big "Add a Bot User" button. From there, mutter _abra kadabra_ and reaveal the token. This token is used as an authorization header against our API like so:\n\n```\ncurl -x POST -h "Authorization: Bot <your token>" https://discordapp.com/api/some-route/that-does-a-thing\n```\n\n> Make sure to preprend your token with "Bot"!\n\nHere are the routes; they all expect JSON bodies. Also, hey, while you\'re here. You\'ve got a bot token. You\'re looking at our API. You should check out all the other [awesome stuff](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) you can do with it!\n\n### Create Lobby\n\n`POST https://discordapp.com/api/v6/lobbies`\n\nCreates a new lobby.

All documentation and functionality can and will change.\n\nMaking a game? Need a whole bunch of fancy APIs to help make it great and your players' lives a breeze? Look no further! The Discord GameSDK is an easy drop-in SDK to help you manage all the hard things that come with making a game. Well, all the hards things about coding it at least. Interpersonal communication skills are on you (have you heard of this cool chat app called Discord?).\n\nOK, cool, so how's it work?\n\n## General Structure\n\nAt a high level, the Discord GameSDK has a class, `Discord`. This class is in charge of the creation of a few \"manager\" sub-classes. They are:\n\n- `ActivityManager` - for Rich Presence and game invites\n- `RelationshipManager` - for users' social relationships across Discord, including friends list\n- `ImageManager` - for getting data about images on Discord, like user avatars or chat images\n- `UserManager` - for fetching user data for a given id and the current user\n- `LobbyManager` - for multiplayer lobbies\n- `NetworkManager` - for all your networking layer needs\n- `ApplicationManager` - for retrieving a user's OAuth2 bearer token, locale, and current game branch\n- `StorageManager` - for saving game data to the disk and the cloud\n- `OverlayManager` - for interacting with Discord's built-in overlay\n\nEach one of these managers contain a number of methods and events used to interact with Discord in the context of the manager. For example, `RelationshipManager` has a function called `Filter()`, which lets you pare down a user's inter-Discord relationships based on a boolean condition, like being friends!\n\n## Functions in the SDK\n\nMost functions in the Discord GameSDK, uh, _function_ in a similar way. They take whatever parameters are required for the function to do its job—a user id, the requested size for an image, etc.—and a callback by means of a function pointer. That callback is fired when the function completes its work, letting you handle events without worrying about piping asynchronously-returned data to the right context.\n\nSome functions behave with a normal return behavior; e.g. `RelationshipManager.Count()` just returns the number directly. Don't worry, it's outlined in the docs.\n\nA quick example with our C# binding:\n\n```c#\nvar userManager = discord.GetUserManager();\nuserManager.GetCurrentUser((result, currentUser) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.OK)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine(currentUser.username);\n    Console.WriteLine(currentUser.ID);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nDebugging is a pain, so before we get into the meat of the SDK, we want to make sure you're prepared for when things go awry. Within the Discord core is a function called `SetLogHook()`. It takes a `level`, which is minimum level of log message you want to listen to, and a callback function:\n\n```cs\npublic void LogProblemsFunction(LogLevel level, string message)\n{\n  Console.WriteLine(\"Discord:{0} - {1}\", level, message);\n}\n\ndiscord.SetLogHook(Discord.LogLevel.Debug, LogProblemFunctions);\n```\n\nYou should begin your integration by setting up this callback to help you debug. Helpfully, if you put a breakpoint inside the callback function you register here, you'll be able to see the stack trace for errors you run into (as long as they fail synchronously). Take the guess work out of debugging, or hey, ignore any and all logging by setting a callback that does nothing. We're not here to judge.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### Result Enum\n\n| value               | description                                                                    |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Ok                  | everything is good                                                             |\n| ServiceUnavailable  | Discord isn't working                                                          |\n| InvalidVersion      | the SDK version may be outdated                                                |\n| LockFailed          | an internal error on transactional operations                                  |\n| InternalError       | something on our side went wrong                                               |\n| InvalidPayload      | the data you sent didn't match what we expect                                  |\n| InvalidCommand      | that's not a thing you can do                                                  |\n| InvalidPermissions  | you aren't authorized to do that                                               |\n| NotFetched          | couldn't fetch what you wanted                                                 |\n| NotFound            | what you're looking for doesn't exist                                          |\n| Conflict            | user already has a network connection open on that channel                     |\n| InvalidSecret       | activity secrets must be unique and not match party id                         |\n| InvalidJoinRequest  | join request for that user does not exist                                      |\n| NoEligibleActivity  | you accidentally set an `ApplicationId` in your `UpdateActivity()` payload     |\n| InvalidInvite       | your game invite is no longer valid                                            |\n| NotAuthenticated    | the internal auth call failed for the user, and you can't do this              |\n| InvalidAccessToken  | the user's bearer token is invalid                                             |\n| ApplicationMismatch | access token belongs to another application                                    |\n| InvalidDataUrl      | something internally went wrong fetching image data                            |\n| InvalidBase64       | not valid Base64 data                                                          |\n| NotFiltered         | you're trying to access the list before creating a stable list with `Filter()` |\n| LobbyFull           | the lobby is full                                                              |\n| InvalidLobbySecret  | the secret you're using to connect is wrong                                    |\n| InvalidFilename     | file name is too long                                                          |\n| InvalidFileSize     | file is too large                                                              |\n| InvalidEntitlement  | the user does not have the right entitlement for this game                     |\n| NotInstalled        | Discord is not installed                                                       |\n| NotRunning          | Discord is not running                                                         |\n\n###### LogLevel Enum\n\n| value   | description                    |\n| ------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Error   | Log only errors                |\n| Warning | Log warnings and errors        |\n| Info    | Log info, warnings, and errors |\n| Debug   | Log _all_ the things!          |\n\n###### CreateFlags Enum\n\n| value            | description                                                         |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Default          | Requires Discord to be running to play the game                     |\n| NoRequireDiscord | Does not require Discord to be running, use this on other platforms |\n\n## Create\n\nCreates an instance of Discord to initialize the SDK.

If the game was _not_ launched from Discord and this method is called, Discord will focus itself and prompt the user for authorization.\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` and an `OAuth2Token` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\napplicationManager.GetOAuth2Token((result, token) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.OK)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Token for the user: {0}. Expires in {1}", token.AccessToken, token.Expires);\n    // You may now use this token against Discord\'s HTTP API\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## ValidateOrExit\n\nChecks if the current user has the entitlement to run this game.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\napplicationManager.ValidateOrExit((result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.OK)\n  {\n    // Game keeps running\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Oops! Something went wrong, closing game...");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Example: Get OAuth2 Token\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\nvar appManager = discord.GetApplicationManager();\n\n// Retrieve the token\nappManager.GetOAuth2Token((token) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine(token.AccessToken);\n\n  // Now send that token off to your server to do your own validation!\n})\n```\n'},1829:function(e,n){e.exports='# Activities\n\n> danger\n> The Discord Store is still in a beta period.

This might be a custom protocol, like `my-awesome-game://`, or a path to an executable. It also supports any lauch parameters that may be needed, like `game.exe --full-screen --no-hax`.\n\nOn macOS, due to the way Discord registers executables, your game needs to be bundled for this command to work. That means it should be a `.app`.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type   | description             |\n| ------- | ------ | ----------------------- |\n| command | string | the command to register |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nactivityManager.RegisterCommand("my-awesome-game://run --full-screen");\n```\n\n## RegisterSteam\n\nUsed if you are distributing this SDK on Steam.

Pages\n\n> danger\n> The Discord Store is still in a beta period. All documentation and functionality can and will change.\n\nNow that you\'ve got a build or two in the system, it\'s time to list them on the store! If you _don\'t_ have builds yet, or you don\'t know what the heck this means, go read [Branches and Builds](#DOCS_DISPATCH_BRANCHES_AND_BUILDS/).\n\n## Some Setup\n\nBefore we create a store page listing, we need to enable ourselves to see the Super Secret Store Section of Discord. To do so, contact us for the super secret password.\n\n## Creating a SKU and Store Page\n\nYou\'ll first need to create the base SKU—an item that can be sold on the store—for your game.\n\n```\ndispatch store listing create <directory> <game_name> <application_id>\n```\n\n`directory` is the name of the local directory that the command will create; this is where you\'ll manage all store page stuff. `game_name` is a string, the name of your game. `application_id` is something we\'ve been using a lot, haven\'t you been paying attention? Sheesh.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\ndispatch store listing create awesome-game "My Awesome Game" 425442952562462720\n```\n\n> <game_name> is limited to 256 characters\n\nThis will generate a SKU and a store listing for the live build of the given application id. You can visit the store page at [https://discordapp.com/store/applications/<application_id>/<sku_id>](https://discordapp.com/store/applications/<application_id>/<sku_id>).\n\nThis command will also spit out the URL for the store page for this SKU. Since we\'ve already given Discord the secret password to see the store via that link earlier, you can navigate to this URL and see your store page in all it\'s glory. OK, well, it\'s not glorious _yet_, but it will be!\n\nNow, let\'s `cd` ourselves into our new `awesome-game/` directory and see what we\'ve got!\n\n## Assets, SKUs, and configs—oh my!\n\nIn your new directory, you\'ll see two folders: `assets/` and `skus/`. Inside `assets/` is a `.metadata.json` file. Don\'t worry about it; Discord uses it to make sure we don\'t upload duplicate assets, but it\'s nothing you need to manage.\n\nInside `skus/` is another folder called `sku-<some_long_number>/`. That long number is your `sku_id`, a unique identifier for this SKU. It\'s super important to Discord, but you don\'t need to do anything with it, other than stare at it admiringly, imagining all the lovely things it will soon represent.\n\nInside _that_ folder is _another_ folder, `descriptions/`—it\'s folders all the way down—as well as a `config.json` file.\n\nThe `descriptions/` folder is where you\'ll put your long-form game descriptions for your store page in the form of different markdown files. The first one we\'ll create is `default.md` for the default language; from there, you can localize your description by creating new files named after a locale code, like `fr.md` or `de.md`.\n\n###### Example Description\n\n```md\n// default.md\n\nThis is my favorite game! This description supports all kinds of markdown, like **bold**, _italics_, ~~strikethroughs~~\n\n# Headings\n\n## Subheadings\n\n![and media embeds](../../../assets/from-local-or-remote-sources.png)\n```\n\n> Markdown files are limited to 5096 characters per file.\n\nYou can see all the locales Discord supports [here](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/). Once you\'ve edited your description to your liking, you can update your store page with:\n\n```\ndispatch store listing update <directory>\n```\n\nIn our case, we\'d run `dispatch store listing update awesome-game`. Head back over to your store page, and see it updated immediately!\n\nNote that if you reference local assets in your description, they will be automatically uploaded to our CDN.\n\n## The. Store. Listing.\n\nThe big one. Your store page, the thing that represents your game to the world on Discord.\n\nScared yet? Don\'t be! Managing your store listing on Discord is super simple. Let\'s take a look at that `/awesome-game/skus/sku-<big_number>/config.json` file we ran away from earlier. We\'re gonna break it down into easier to digest chunks, and then put it all back together at the end.\n\n### Your IDs, Uniquely You\n\n```json\n{\n  "id": "456924821524316170",\n  "application_id": "425442752562462720",\n  "store_listing_id": "456924822581149707",\n  "related_sku_ids": [],\n  "dependent_sku_id": null,\n  "manifest_labels": []\n}\n```\n\nThese are the nuts and bolts of your store page; they help to organize everything properly in Discord\'s backend infrastructure so we know exactly what this SKU is. By the way, if you aren\'t familiar, a "SKU" is basically some item that can be bought and sold on the store: a game, DLC, IAP, a pack of gems, a skin for a hero, etc. Your application can and will have many SKUs within it.\n\nThe `id`, `application_id`, and `store_listing_id` are all generated for you when you create the SKU. They\'re the unique identifiers for this particular item. `related_sku_ids` is a list of ids from other SKUs in your application. Putting those ids in this list will ensure they show up as available DLC on this store page.\n\nIf this store listing is for DLC, IAP, or other non-base-game items, you\'ll want to put the SKU id of the base game as the `depedent_sku_id`. This will ensure that players can\'t accidentally purchase your expansion pack without already owning the base game.\n\n`manifest_labels` is an **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL** part of this file, so listen up! Back when you uploaded your games to Discord, you marked off different bundles of files as manifests, like `game-data` and `locales/english`. Each of these labels has its own id; you can see them with\n\n```\ndispatch manifest-label list <application_id>\n```\n\nThat command will spit out a list of manifest labels for your application and their corresponding ids. **`manifest_labels` is an array of ALL the ids, entered as strings, that could need to be downloaded when purchasing and installing this SKU.** For example, we want to include the manifest label ids for `game-data` and `locales/english`. If you also had a manifest for `locales/french` for your wonderful French users, you\'d want to include that in the array as well. We\'ll pick the right files to give the user based on their locale and the languages you marked off for each manifest.\n\n### The Good Stuff: Artwork, Summary, Price\n\n```json\n{\n  "type": "game",\n  "access_type": "full",\n  "release_date": "2018-09-01",\n  "carousel_items": [\n    "asset://carousel_1.jpg",\n    "asset://carousel_2.jpg",\n    "asset://carousel_3.jpg",\n    "youtube://f5Q041c0Sis"\n  ],\n  "name": {\n    "default": "My Awesome Game"\n  },\n  "summary": {\n    "default": "This is a test.",\n    "en-GB": "adadad"\n  },\n  "price_tier": 1999,\n  "price": {\n    "aud": 1499\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> `summary` and `name` are limited to 1024 characters per localized string. Also, if your game is in our Discord Nitro subscription service, don\'t set a price.\n\nNext come the important, top-level parts of your store listing—art, descriptions, and price! Starting from the top:\n\n- `type`: `game` or `dlc`, denoting if this store listing is for a base game, or something to purchase _for_ the base game\n- `access_type`: `full`, `early access`, or `vip`\n- `release_date`: the release date for your game in `yyyy-mm-dd` format\n- `carousel_items`: a list of images and videos to go in the art carousel at the top of the page\n  - YouTube Video: `youtube://<video_id>`\n  - Image: `asset://<local_path_to_asset>`\n\n> Assets should be either .jpg or .png format, and 1920x1080 resolution.\n\n`price_tier` is how Discord manages prices. Rather than setting an arbitrary default value for USD, you choose a price tier at which to price your game in USD; from there, you can override prices in other locales if you feel you need to. `price_tier` is a mandatory field for any game not in Discord\'s Nitro Subscription service; if your game is free, the price tier would be `0`. For a full list of prices tiers, see [here](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/price-tiers).\n\nIf you really feel the need to, you _can_ override the base USD price. If you do so, it must be higher than the next lowest price tier. That means that if you want to set the `usd` override at `1124`, your `price_tier` should be `1099`. But, in reality, you should not need to override the base USD price. Just pick the best tier! To see a list of supported currencies for overriding, look [here](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/supported-third-party-currencies).\n\nYou\'ll notice that `name,` `summary`, and `price` are mappings between locales/currencies and localized values. This is how Discord currently supports localization, much like the longer markdown description files mentioned earlier. `name` is the name of your game, and `summary` is a short, one-line blurb that will appear just under the image carousel. Save your predisposition for prolific prose for the description; keep this short! `price` is, of course, the price; note that `1999` is equivalent to $19.99.\n\n### The Nitty Gritty: System Requirements, Features, Ratings, Legal\n\n```json\n{\n  "system_requirements": {\n    "windows": {\n      "minimum": {\n        "operating system version": {\n          "default": "Windows XP or newer",\n          "de": "Windows XP oder neuer"\n        },\n        "cpu": {\n          "default": "Dual Core from Intel or AMD at 2.8 GHz",\n          "de": "Dual Core von Intel oder AMD mit 2,8 GHz"\n        },\n        "gpu": "Intel HD 3000",\n        "ram": 2000,\n        "disk": 20000,\n        "sound card": {\n          "default": "DirectX Compatible",\n          "de": "DirectX-kompatibel"\n        },\n        "directx": {\n          "default": "Version 9.0c",\n          "de": "Version 9.0c"\n        },\n        "network": {\n          "default": "Broadband Internet connection",\n          "de": "Breitbandinternetverbindung"\n        },\n        "notes": null\n      },\n      "recommended": {\n        "operating system version": {\n          "default": "Windows 10"\n        },\n        "cpu": {"default": "Whatever NASA puts in the rockets"},\n        "gpu": {"default": "Stick, like, 4 GTX 1080TIs together"},\n        "ram": 2000,\n        "disk": 20000,\n        "sound card": {"default": "JayZ in your living room hooked up to your PC"},\n        "directx": {"default": "Version 12.0"},\n        "network": {"default": "Gigabit or bust"},\n        "notes": null\n      }\n    },\n    "macos": {},\n    "linux": {}\n  },\n  "legal_notice": {\n    "default": "Don\'t buy this",\n    "es-ES": "Por favor, no lo compres."\n  },\n  "content_ratings": {\n    "esrb": {\n      "rating": "teen",\n      "descriptors": ["fantasy_violence"]\n    },\n    "pegi": {}\n  },\n  "features": ["discord_game_invites", "single_player", "online_multiplayer", "cloud_saves", "rich_presence"],\n  "locales": ["ru", "fr", "ko", "en-US", "tr", "it", "zh-CN", "pt-BR", "ro", "es-ES", "ja"]\n}\n```\n\n> `legal_notice` is limited to 1024 characters per localized string\n\nLast but not least is the nitty gritty of the page, including system requirements and legal notices. Again, from the top!\n\n`system_requirements` are the minimum and recommended system requirements for windows, macos, and linux. The inner fields are self-explanatory; notice that some fields that require more freeform text support localization, whereas some like `ram` and `disk` (both measured in MB, by the way) are just numbers.\n\nIf your game has any required legal notices, they can be included and localized here under `legal_notice`. `content_ratings` provide space for ratings and descriptors for both ESRB and PEGI rating systems. These fields accept a pre-selected set of values. `features` is also a pre-selected set of values. `locales` are the different language locales your game supports; you can choose from any locale that Discord supports. All of these values are outlined [here](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/).\n\nOnce you\'re happy with how you\'ve described your game, give it another `dispatch store listing update awesome-game`, and watch your store page populate with great data!\n\n### A Completed Example\n\nHere\'s what a completed config file looks like all put together.

All documentation and functionality can and will change.\n\nIf you're distributing a game on Discord, you'll need to send us the files! We quickly learned that email has a file size limit, and we ran out of carrier pigeons. Don't ask. Very touchy subject.\n\nIn light of those learnings, we built Dispatch! Great name, isn't it? _Dis_-patch? Anyway, Dispatch is your all-in-one uploader tool to get your builds, artwork, patches, DLC, and anything else onto Discord's servers. It's fast, easy to use, and I've been assured by our engineers that it's made of 100% farm-raised, cage-free, grass-fed code.\n\nDispatch will also be your tool for updating your store page on Discord while we work diligently on our new Developer Portal, which will provide you with a delightful way to manage your store page in the future. For now, keep that terminal handy, and get your developers' permission before pushing changes.\n\nI mean, you don't actually _need_ their permission. But hey, a second set of eyes is always helpful, right?\n\nLet's get you pointed in the right direction; follow this little Table of Contents to start, and you'll be a pro with this tool faster than you can say \"But wait I don't actually know what a terminal is.\"\n\n1.

[Pre-defined Field Values for Store Pages](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/)\n\n> info\n> To use Dispatch, you will need an application id for your game. You should have gotten this id when you set yourself up to use the Store SDK, but if not, ask a Discord team member to create an application for you and get you the id.\n"},1834:function(e,n){e.exports='# Branches and Builds\n\n> danger\n> The Discord Store is still in a beta period. All documentation and functionality can and will change.\n\nIn order for other people to download your game from Discord\'s servers, you need to _upload_ your game to Discord\'s servers. Let\'s learn how to do that!\n\n## Getting Set Up\n\nFirst, get Dispatch. If you don\'t already have it, ask us for access!\n\nYou\'ll want to be able to use Dispatch across your projects, so let\'s handle that now by adding it to our PATH.\n\n**MacOS/Linux:**\n\nBust out those \\*nix skills.\n\n- Open your choice of terminal\n- Stick dispatch in a folder that will be added to your PATH. If you don\'t have a good spot for this stuff already, you can `mkdir ~/bin/` and call that Dispatch\'s new home (as well as any other executables you might want to access in the future)\n- In that folder, run `chmod u+x dispatch-macos` so that Dispatch can be used as an executable\n  - Feel free to also rename `dispatch-macos` to just `dispatch` if you don\'t feel like typing so much\n- Add that ~/bin directory to your path in a permanent way. I have `export PATH=$PATH:~/bin` at the bottom of my `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bashrc`\n- Restart your terminal\n- `echo $PATH` and make sure you see the directory in the output\n- Run `dispatch --help` to make sure it works\n\nYou\'re good! You can now call the dispatch command from anywhere!\n\n**Windows**\n\nNot as 1337 as some scripting skillz, but the Windows GUI will do just fine\n\n- Stick `dispatch-x64` or `dispatch-x86`, depending on your OS, in a folder that will be added to your PATH\n  - Feel free to rename it to just `dispatch` if you don\'t feel like typing so much\n- Hit that Windows key and start typing "Environment Variables"\n- Select "Edit the system environment variables"\n- Hit the "Environment Variables" button in the bottom right\n- Edit the PATH entry for either the system or the current user, adding dispatch\'s directory\n- Restart your command line\n- Run `dispatch --help` to make sure it works\n\nYou\'re good! You can now call the dispatch command from anywhere!\n\n> info\n> Want some really fancy skills? You can set up autocompletions for dispatch in whatever shell you work.\n> Run `dispatch completions -—help` to see instructions for a variety of popular shells.\n\n## Authorizing Yourself to Use It\n\nRun `dispatch login`, which will open a web browser and prompt you to authorize your Discord account with Dispatch.\n\nYup, that\'s it.\n\nONWARDS!\n\n## Creating Branches\n\n> During development time, we ask that you DO NOT create your own OAuth2 application. When you are ready to begin development, let someone on the Discord team know, and we will create an application for you and assign it to your account. We have some special flags that we need to enable on your behalf.\n\nNow that we\'re set up to use the tool, let\'s make some branches! Branches, builds, and everything in between in Discord are tied to an application. To get one for your game, ask a Discord team member to hook you up!\n\nThen, head over to our [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/), click into that new application, and copy the `Client Id` at the top of the page, keeping it handy throughout this process. Client ID and "application id" are interchangeable phrases. For the rest of this documentation, we\'ll refer to it as application id.\n\nBack to your terminal, type:\n\n```\ndispatch branch create <application_id> <branch_name>\n```\n\nThis will create a named branch under that application id that can be pushed to. You can see your branches with:\n\n```\ndispatch branch list <application_id>\n```\n\n## Setting Up Our First Build\n\nIn order for Discord to understand what you\'re sending, you need to set up a config file for your game. This config file tells Discord which files to bundle together, how to run them, and other metadata to include. You should keep this file safe in your version control system of choice; that way, Discord is always up to date with whatever you\'ve got locally. You\'ll reference these manifests later when building your store pages, so that Discord knows what to download to someone\'s computer when they hit that Big Buy Button.\n\nLet\'s break an example `config.json` file down into pieces, and then put it together at the end.\n\n```js\n{\n  "application": {\n    "id": 467102538279999224,\n    "manifests": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is the top level of the config file. It has an `application` object at the top. `id` is your application id. `manifests` are the heart of this file, and offer a lot of customization for tagging and uploading data for the build. Let\'s jump into that now.\n\n```js\n{\n  "label": "my-awesome-game/windows",\n  "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n  "locales": [],\n  "local_root": "./game-files/windows",\n  "redistributables": [\n    "directx_june_2010"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n`manifests` is an array of objects that denote file bundles; part of that object is listed here. `label` is the name you want to give an individual manifest/bundle of files. `platforms` are the platforms for which it is valid. `locales` is an array of locales for which the manifest is valid; leaving it empty denotes it\'s valid for all locales. `local_root` is the relative path to the directory that contains the raw game files to upload for this manifest. This may be particularly useful if you have multiple manifests with different relative root directories, like:\n\n```json\n// Imaginary directory structure:\n// C:\\game\\binary\n// C:\\game\\langs\\en-US\n// C:\\game\\langes\\fr\n\n"manifests": [\n  {\n    "label": "game-files",\n    "local_root": "binary",\n  },\n  {\n    "label": "english-language-pack",\n    "local_root": "en-US",\n  },\n  {\n    "label": "french-language-pack",\n    "local_root": "fr",\n  }\n]\n```\n\n`redistributables` is an array of any redistributable packages your game may need to function, like a certain install of DirectX, or a Microsoft C++ redistributable. A list of valid values can be found in [Field Values](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/).\n\n```js\n{\n  "file_rules": {\n    "mappings": [\n      {\n        "local_path": ".",\n        "install_path": "."\n      },\n      {\n        "local_path": "./languages/en-US/no-but-the-data-is-really-in-here/"\n        "install_path": "./english"\n      }\n    ],\n    "properties": [\n      {\n        "install_path": "save/*",\n        "attributes": ["user_data"]\n      }\n    ],\n    "exclusions": [\n      {\n        "local_path": "**/*.pdb"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is another subset of a manifest object, `file_rules`. `file_rules` allows you to mark certain globs of files with certain tags, so Dispatch can handle them specially.\n\n`mappings` lets you tell Dispatch to download files to a certain place in the install directory on a user\'s machine, letting you create the folder structure you need.\n\n`properties` allows you to mark properties on globs of files. In this case, marking a glob of files as `"user_data"` tells Dispatch not to touch these files in any way if it sees them; don\'t want that save data overwritten!\n\n`exclusions` also allow you to mark off globs of files. Files globs here will not be uploaded by Dispatch on a build push. In the above example, debug files that match the `*.pdb` pattern in any directory will be ignored. We also explicitly ignore linux and osx server and client distributables, since this manifest is for Windows.\n\n> warn\n> Dispatch supports [Rust globbing patterns](https://docs.rs/glob/0.2.11/glob/struct.Pattern.html).\n\n```js\n{\n  "launch_commands": {\n    "win32": {\n      "executable": "my-awesome-game-32.exe",\n      "arguments": []\n    },\n    "win64": {\n      "executable": "my-awesome-game-64.exe",\n      "arguments": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe last bit of the config file is the launch commands for your game. Here, you should specify the executables for the platforms for this manifest (if there are any) and any arguments they require.\n\nLet\'s see what one looks like all together!\n\n```js\n{\n  "application": {\n    "id": 467102538279999224,\n    "manifests": [\n      {\n        "label": "my-awesome-game/windows",\n        "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n        "locales": [],\n        "local_root": "./",\n        "file_rules": {\n          "properties": [\n            {\n              "install_path": "save/*",\n              "attributes": ["user_data"]\n            }\n          ],\n          "exclusions": [\n            {\n              "local_path": "**/*.pdb"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        "launch_commands": {\n          "win32": {\n            "executable": "my-awesome-game-32.exe",\n            "arguments": []\n          },\n          "win64": {\n            "executable": "my-awesome-game-64.exe",\n            "arguments": []\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## DRM\n\nYou can choose to add DRM to your game. Dispatch will wrap your executables and prevent a user from launching the game if they are not logged into Discord.\n\n> danger\n> This is a destructive operation. It will wrap your executable in place. It will not back up your executable. Make sure you have a backup somewhere else.\n\nIf you understand and agree to the above, run the following command on each of the executables you want to wrap.\n\n```\ndispatch build drm-wrap <application_id> <path_to_executable_to_wrap>\n```\n\n## Pushing Our First Build\n\nWe\'ve got all our files ready for processing; let\'s ship this baby!\n\n```\ndispatch build push <branch_id> <path_to_config> <path_to_files_to_upload>\n```\n\nYou\'ll see a bunch of request logging as it gets sent up to Discord—when it\'s done, you\'re greeted with a friendly completion message:\n\n```\n[2018-06-14][11:38:51][INFO] Pushed build. build_id=456889899375656960\n```\n\nTo double check that it\'s all ready for publishing, run:\n\n```\ndispatch build list <application_id> <branch_id>\n```\n\nYou\'ll see a table with the current status of your builds. Once the one you uploaded is marked as READY, you\'re good to publish it to the masses!\n\n## Publishing Our First Build\n\nOnce you\'re ready to make a build live, run:\n\n```\ndispatch build publish <application_id> <branch_id> <build_id>\n```\n\nTo make sure it worked, you can again run:\n\n```\ndispatch branch list <application_id>\n```\n\nAnd look for a `LIVE_BUILD_ID` under your application!\n\n## Downloading a Build for Testing\n\nNow that you\'ve got a build pushed and published, we should make sure that what you\'ve sent out into the world works as intended. You can download your published build on a given branch to your local machine with the command:\n\n```\ndispatch build update <application_id> <branch_id> <install_path> --platform <value> --locale <value>\n```\n\n`install_path` is any filepath on your local machine; this is where the files will be downloaded to. `--platform` and `--locale` are whatever values you set as valid platforms and locales in your config file for a given build. The default probably looks something like `win64` and `en-US`.\n\nHere\'s an example of the command with our info:\n\n```\ndispatch build update 467102538279999224 456889899375659999 C:\\my-game C:\\my-game\\MANIFEST --platform win64 --locale en-US\n```\n\nNow you can run the executable for your game in that directory and make sure it works!\n\n## Patching\n\nIf you need to push out a patch or a new build, no problem! Just repeat the process:\n\n- Update your game files locally to whatever they need to be\n- Push your build again\n- Publish the build again\n- List your branches to make sure the new build is live\n\nDiscord will do some magic in the background to diff your files, ensuring that your players only have to download the changes they need and letting them do it quickly so they can get back in the game. Or, really, without them even needing to know there _was_ a patch! Your players will automatically download your latest and greatest stuff, and quickly!\n\nNow that you\'ve got a game in the system, let\'s [create a store page](#DOCS_DISPATCH_MANAGING_STORE_LISTINGS) for it!\n'},1835:function(e,n){e.exports="# API Reference\n\nDiscord's API is based around two core layers, a HTTPS/REST API for general operations, and persistent secure websocket based connection for sending and subscribing to real-time events. The most common use case of the Discord API will be providing a service, or access to a platform through the [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) API.\n\n###### Base URL\n\n```\nhttps://discordapp.com/api\n```\n\n## API Versioning\n\n>danger\n>Some API and Gateway versions are now non-functioning, and are labeled as discontinued in the table below for posterity. Trying to use these versions will fail and return 400 Bad Request.\n\nDiscord exposes different versions of our API. You can specify version by including it in the request path like `https://discordapp.com/api/v{version_number}`. Omitting the version number from the route will route requests to the current default version (marked below accordingly). You can find the change log for the newest API version [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/change-log).\n\n###### API Versions\n\n| Version | Status | Default |\n| ------- | ------ | ------- |\n| 6 | Available | ✓ |\n| 5 | Discontinued | |\n| 4 | Discontinued | |\n| 3 | Discontinued | | |\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthenticating with the Discord API can be done in one of two ways:\n\n1. Using a bot token gained by [registering a bot](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/registering-applications), for more information on bots see [bots vs user accounts](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/bot-vs-user-accounts).\n2. Using an OAuth2 bearer token gained through the [OAuth2 API](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/oauth2).\n\nFor all authentication types, authentication is performed with the `Authorization` HTTP header in the format `Authorization: TOKEN_TYPE TOKEN`.\n\n###### Example Bot Token Authorization Header\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bot MTk4NjIyNDgzNDcxOTI1MjQ4.Cl2FMQ.ZnCjm1XVW7vRze4b7Cq4se7kKWs\n```\n\n###### Example Bearer Token Authorization Header\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer CZhtkLDpNYXgPH9Ml6shqh2OwykChw\n```\n\n## Encryption\n\nAll HTTP-layer services and protocols (e.g. http, websocket) within the Discord API use TLS 1.2.\n\n## Snowflakes\n\nDiscord utilizes Twitter's [snowflake](https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/tree/snowflake-2010) format for uniquely identifiable descriptors (IDs). These IDs are guaranteed to be unique across all of Discord, except in some unique scenarios in which child objects share their parent's ID. Because Snowflake IDs are up to 64 bits in size (e.g. a uint64), they are always returned as strings in the HTTP API to prevent integer overflows in some languages. See [Gateway ETF/JSON](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/etf-json) for more information regarding Gateway encoding.\n\n###### Snowflake ID Broken Down in Binary\n\n```\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 11111 11111 111111111111\n64                                         22    17    12          0\n```\n\n###### Snowflake ID Format Structure (Left to Right)\n\n| Field | Bits | Number of bits | Description | Retrieval |\n|-------|------|----------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Timestamp | 63 to 22 | 42 bits | Milliseconds since Discord Epoch, the first second of 2015 or 1420070400000. | ``(snowflake >> 22) + 1420070400000`` |\n| Internal worker ID | 21 to 17 | 5 bits | | ``(snowflake & 0x3E0000) >> 17`` |\n| Internal process ID | 16 to 12 | 5 bits | | ``(snowflake & 0x1F000) >> 12`` |\n| Increment | 11 to 0 | 12 bits | For every ID that is generated on that process, this number is incremented | ``snowflake & 0xFFF`` |\n\n### Convert Snowflake to DateTime\n\n![snowflake-composition](snowflake.png)\n\n## Nullable and Optional Resource Fields\n\nResource fields that may contain a `null` value have types that are prefixed with a question mark.\nResource fields that are optional have names that are suffixed with a question mark.\n\n###### Example Nullable and Optional Fields\n\n| Field | Type |\n| ----- | ---- |\n| optional_field? | string |\n| nullable_field | ?string |\n| optional_and_nullable_field? | ?string |\n\n## Consistency\n\nDiscord operates at a scale where true consistency is impossible. Because of this, lots of operations in our API and in-between our services are [eventually consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency). Due to this, client actions can never be serialized and may be executed in _any_ order (if executed at all). Along with these constraints, events in Discord may:\n\n- Never be sent to a client\n- Be sent _exactly_ one time to the client\n- Be sent up to N times per client\n\nClients should operate on events and results from the API in as much of a idempotent behavior as possible.\n\n## HTTP API\n\n### User Agent\n\nClients using the HTTP API must provide a valid [User Agent](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.43) which specifies information about the client library and version in the following format:\n\n###### User Agent Example\n\n```\nUser-Agent: DiscordBot ($url, $versionNumber)\n```\n\nClients may append more information and metadata to the _end_ of this string as they wish.\n\n### Rate Limiting\n\nThe HTTP API implements a process for limiting and preventing excessive requests in accordance with [RFC 6585](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4). API users that regularly hit and ignore rate limits will have their API keys revoked, and be blocked from the platform. For more information on rate limiting of requests, please see the [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits) section.\n\n## Gateway (WebSocket) API\n\nDiscord's Gateway API is used for maintaining persistent, stateful websocket connections between your client and our servers. These connections are used for sending and receiving real-time events your client can use to track and update local state. The Gateway API uses secure websocket connections as specified in [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455). For information on opening Gateway connections, please see the [Gateway API](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways) section.\n\n>warn\n>A bot must connect to and identify with a gateway at least once before it can use the [Create Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/create-message) endpoint.\n>If your only requirement is to send messages to a channel, consider using a [Webhook](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK) instead.\n\n## Message Formatting\n\nDiscord utilizes a subset of markdown for rendering message content on its clients, while also adding some custom functionality to enable things like mentioning users and channels. This functionality uses the following formats:\n\n###### Formats\n\n| Type | Structure | Example |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| User | <@USER_ID> | <@80351110224678912> |\n| User (Nickname) | <@!USER_ID> | <@!80351110224678912> |\n| Channel | <#CHANNEL_ID> | <#103735883630395392> |\n| Role | <@&ROLE_ID> | <@&165511591545143296> |\n| Custom Emoji | <:NAME:ID> | <:mmLol:216154654256398347> |\n| Custom Emoji (Animated) | <a:NAME:ID> | <a:b1nzy:392938283556143104> |\n\nUsing the markdown for either users, roles, or channels will mention the target(s) accordingly.\n\n## Image Formatting\n\n###### Image Base Url\n\n```\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/\n```\n\nDiscord uses ids and hashes to render images in the client. These hashes can be retrieved through various API requests, like [Get User](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-user). Below are the formats, size limitations, and CDN endpoints for images in Discord. The returned format can be changed by changing the [extension name](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting-image-formats) at the end of the URL. The returned size can be changed by appending a querystring of `?size=desired_size` to the URL. Image size can be any power of two between 16 and 2048.\n\n###### Image Formats\n\n| Name | Extension |\n|-------|------------|\n| JPEG | .jpg, .jpeg |\n| PNG | .png |\n| WebP | .webp |\n| GIF | .gif |\n\n###### CDN Endpoints\n\n| Type | Path | Supports |\n| ---- | --- | -------- |\n| Custom Emoji | emojis/[emoji_id](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object).png | PNG, GIF |\n| Guild Icon | icons/[guild_id](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object)/[guild_icon](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object).png | PNG, JPEG, WebP |\n| Guild Splash | splashes/[guild_id](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object)/[guild_splash](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object).png | PNG, JPEG, WebP |\n| Default User Avatar | embed/avatars/[user_discriminator](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object).png * | PNG |\n| User Avatar | avatars/[user_id](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object)/[user_avatar](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object).png \\*\\* | PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF |\n| Application Icon | app-icons/[application_id](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top)/[icon](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/get-current-application-information).png | PNG, JPEG, WebP |\n\n\\* In the case of the Default User Avatar endpoint, the value for `user_discriminator` in the path should be the user's discriminator modulo 5—Test#1337 would be `1337 % 5`, which evaluates to 2.\n\n\\*\\* In the case of the User Avatar endpoint, the value of `user_avatar` will begin with `a_` if it is available in GIF format.

TERMINATION\n\nWithout prejudice to any other rights or remedies that we may have,\nDiscord may terminate the license granted hereunder: (i) upon notice if Licensee fails to comply\nwith any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement; or (ii) for convenience, upon thirty (30)\ndays’ prior written notice. In addition, Discord may terminate or suspend the license granted\nhereunder if your Application(s) for any reason compromise or threaten to compromise the\nintegrity of Discord’s service. In the event the license is terminated, Licensee shall discontinue\nany further use, and destroy all copies, of the API or SDK and Documentation in its possession\nor control. Sections 1.2, 1.3, 4-9 and 11-16 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n\n### 7\\. NO WARRANTY\n\nTHE API OR SDK AND DOCUMENTATION ARE BEING\nPROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF\nMERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n### 8\\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nLAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL DISCORD OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR\nRESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES\n(COLLECTIVELY, THE "DISCORD PARTIES") BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR\nDAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR\nLOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF INFORMATION\nOR DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE API OR SDK\nOR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY EVENT, THE DISCORD PARTIES’\nTOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND AND\nTYPE (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT OR TORT) SHALL NOT\nEXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE LICENSE FEE (IF ANY) PAID BY YOU FOR THE\nAPI OR SDK OR (B) $100. THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS\nAGREEMENT DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER RIGHTS THAT\nCANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. Some jurisdictions do not allow the\nexclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,\nwhich means that some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you. IN\nTHESE JURISDICTIONS, DISCORD’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE\nGREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\nIT IS EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT IN THE EVENT ANY REMEDY\nHEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, ALL\nLIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH HEREIN\nSHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT.\n\n### 9\\.

All of our [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-api-docs) and we would\n<3 corrections and improvements!\n\n## Getting Help\n\nIf you believe you're experiencing a bug with our API or want to report incorrect documentation, open an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-api-docs/issues).\n\nFor a more real-time avenue of communication, check out the [unofficial, community-driven Discord server for developers](https://discord.gg/discord-api). There you'll find community members who can help answer questions about our API, community libraries, bot creation, and other development questions.\n\n## Applications (aka Apps)\n\nMaking an app on Discord opens up many possibilities for deeper integrations with your other services and platforms.\nHere are some examples to whet your appetite:\n\n- Using your Discord account to safely login to your guild's website\n- Display who’s online or in-game on your website or forum\n- Automatically join private Discord servers or gain new roles based on external website permissions\n- Other neat things.\n\nHead over to our new [applications page](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top) to dive into creating your own custom juice.\n\n## Games (aka Games)\n\nDiscord is built around the idea of bringing people together through games. As part of that goal, we want to offer ways for game developers to work closely with us and make awesome stuff. [Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) is a great way to more deeply integrate with Discord! It lets you:\n\n- Show more detailed status information on your players' profiles\n- Allow your players to create invites in Discord for others to play with them\n- Launch into game sessions, parties, and groups directly from Discord\n- Launch into your game's spectate mode directly from Discord\n- Allow your players to ask to join their friends' games\n\nRich Presence is free, open-sourced, and self-serve, so check out [the How To guide](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_HOW_TO/) and get started!\n\nThose looking to test out the waters before jumping into the deep end with a technical integration should check out our [Verified Servers](https://discordapp.com/verification) program.

This change has been in effect for a long time, but the documentation was not updated.\n\n## Deprecation: RPC online member count and members list\n\n#### June 11, 2018\n\nWe released server changes that allow guilds to represent an incomplete state of the member list in our clients, which results in inaccurate member lists and online counts over RPC. These fields are now deprecated and will now return an empty members array and an online count of 0 moving forward.\n\n## Enhancement: New Message Properties\n\n#### February 5, 2018\n\nAdditional `activity` and `application` fields—as well as corresponding object documentation—have been added to the [Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object in support of our newly-released [Spotify integration](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000167212-Discord-Spotify-Connection) and previous Rich Presence enhancements.\n\n## Enhancement: Get Guild Emoji Endpoint\n\n#### January 30, 2018\n\nThe [Get Guild Emoji](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/get-guild-emoji) response now also includes a user object if the emoji was added by a user.\n\n## Deprecation: Accept Invite Endpoint\n\n#### January 23, 2018\n\nThe [Accept Invite](#DOCS_RESOURCES_INVITE/accept-invite) endpoint is deprecated starting today, and will be discontinued on March 23, 2018. The [Add Guild Member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/add-guild-member) endpoint should be used in its place.\n\n## Semi-Breaking Change: Very Large Bot Sharding\n\n#### January 3, 2018\n\nAdditional sharding requirements and information for bots in over 100,000 guilds has been added. This requires a small change in numbers of shards for affected bots. See the [documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sharding-for-very-large-bots) for more information.\n\n## New Feature: Rich Presence\n\n#### November 9, 2017\n\nRich Presence is now live and available for all developers! Rich Presence allows developers to closely integrate with Discord in a number of new, cool ways like:\n\n- Showing more information about a user's current game in their profile\n- Allowing users to post invitations to join their party or spectate their game in chat\n- Displaying \"Spectate\" and \"Ask to Join\" buttons on users' profiles\n\nFor more information, check out our [Rich Presence site](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence). To get started on development, [read the docs](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_HOW_TO/)!\n\n## Breaking Change: API & Gateway Below v6 Discontinued\n\n#### October 16, 2017\n\n[API](#DOCS_REFERENCE/api-versioning) and [Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-protocol-versions) versions below v6 are now discontinued after being previously deprecated. Version 6 is now the default API and Gateway version. Attempting to use a version below 6 will result in an error.\n\n## New Feature: Channel Categories\n\n#### September 20, 2017\n\nChanges have been made throughout the documentation to reflect the addition of channel categories to Discord. These includes an additional field—`parent_id`—to the base [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-obect) object and a new [channel category example](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-example-channel-category).\n\n## New Feature: Emoji Endpoints\n\n#### September 10, 2017\n\n[Emoji endpoints](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-resource) have been added to the API. Bots can now manage guild emojis to their robo-hearts' content!\n\n## Breaking Change: Presence Activity Objects\n\n#### August 16, 2017\n\nThe `type` field in the [activity object](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/activity-object) for [Gateway Status Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-status) and [Presence Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update) payloads is no longer optional when the activity object is not null.\n\n## Breaking Change: Default Channels\n\n#### August 3, 2017\n\nAfter today, we are changing how default channels function. The \"default\" channel for a given user is now the channel with the highest position that their permissions allow them to see. New guilds will no longer have a default channel with the same id as the guild. Existing guilds will not have their #general channel id changed. It is possible, if permissions are set in such a way, that a user will not have a default channel in a guild.\n\nWe saw a use case in many servers where the previously-default #general channel was being repurposed as an announcement-only, non-writable channel for new members by using bots to clear the entire message history. Now, that channel can simply be deleted and re-created with the desired permissions. This change also allows dynamic default channels for users based on permissions.\n\nWe are also rolling out a change in conjunction that will allow Discord to remember your last-visited channel in a guild across sessions. Newly-joined users will be directed to the guild's default channel on first join; existing members will return to whichever channel they last visited.\n\n## New Feature: Audit Logs\n\n#### July 24, 2017\n\nAudit logs are here! Well, they've been here all along, but now we've got [documentation](#DOCS_AUDIT_LOG/audit-logs) about them. Check it out, but remember: with great power comes great responsibility.\n\n## Breaking Change: Version 6\n\n#### July 19, 2017\n\n- [Channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) Object\n  - `is_private` removed\n  - [`type`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-channel-types) is now an integer\n  - `recipient` is now `recipients`, an array of [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) objects\n- [Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) Object\n  - [`type`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object-message-types) added to support system messages\n- [Status Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-status-gateway-status-update-structure) Object\n  - `idle_since` renamed to `since`\n"}}]);
